‚û°Ô∏è Groq: Ensuring Speed
Groq accelerates computations, making the app responsive even when running large models like LLAMA 3.
‚û°Ô∏è LLAMA 3: The Creative Engine
LLAMA 3, Meta‚Äôs advanced language model, generates high-quality, human-like lyrics in multiple languages like Hindi, French, and Korean.
‚û°Ô∏è Streamlit: The User Interface
Streamlit provides a clean, interactive UI where users can select a language, specify a genre, and generate lyrics with a single click.

üéµ Key Features
Multilingual Support: Generate songs in multiple languages.
Dynamic Genres: From inspirational to romantic, tailor your lyrics to fit your mood.

80,81,"Story behind the photo:Year 2013 , Lei Jun, CEO of Xiaomi Technology visited Tesla, accompanied by a certain VP of #globalsourcing and #supplychain from Tesla, Peter Carlsson., also known later as the founder of NorthVolt.

By then, Xiaomi Technology was merely known as a Chinese smartphone challenger with high cost-performance ratio.

Both of them saw the tremendous potential in #EV, but life ironically drove them to different paths. Long story short:

- In 2015, Peter Carlsson cofounded Northvolt and raised biggest funding ever in European history (15billions$). Earlier this month, NorthVolt filed for bankruptcy under chapiter 11 in US and Peter Carlsson stepped down from the position of CEO.

- Lei Jun founded Xiaomi Auto much later in 2021. He announced to fully self-fund the project, ¬´¬†I‚Äôm ready to put my whole personal fortune and entrepreneurial reputation for this ultimate battle¬†¬ª. 
For the outsiders, year 2021 wasn‚Äôt exactly the best timing for entering the game . The #EV market landscape was already a Red Sea with incumbents but especillay the emerging automakers (Nio, Xpeng, LI, Leapmotor..) 

Against all odds, Xiaomi Auto reached serial production of SU7 in a record breaking time of 230 days with 100000 deliveries, whereas Tesla took 12 years (2003-2015) to reach the same milestone. Ok, the comparaison isn‚Äôt fair as Tesla laid ground work for everyone else, but still. 

Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford Motor Company says he's been driving a Xiaomi EV for the past 6 months and doesn't want to give it up.

So, what could be possible reasons that drove the differences of outcome ? 
It‚Äôs obviously a compound result but let‚Äôs take some wild guesses:

Skellefte√•, the Swedish factory location of NorthVolt, where daily sunlight varies between 2hs and 20hours with a local population of 30000people. Can we seriously imagine world class talents ( workers as well as engineers) are attracted to move in with their families?

On the other hand , Lei Jun was known as the ¬´¬†spammer ¬ª, as a CEO of Fortune 500 company, he once called personally 90 times some big shot engineer , just to ¬´¬†beg¬†¬ª him to join the company. Sam Altman also shared similar approach through early days of OpenAI  .

From winning presidential election to building world‚Äôs most successful company , Everything boils down to having the right people around you.  

If you‚Äôre lucky enough to have them, cherish them. If not, go get them.",1,,

104,105,"OpenAI's o1 models, introduced in September 2024, represent a significant advancement in AI reasoning capabilities, designed to tackle complex problems across various domains, particularly excelling in STEM fields. 

The o1 series, which includes o1-preview and o1-mini variants, utilizes reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought reasoning to spend more time thinking before responding, resulting in improved performance on challenging tasks such as mathematics, coding, and scientific research. 

While offering enhanced reasoning abilities and reduced hallucination rates compared to previous models, o1 models operate at slower inference speeds and higher computational costs, making them particularly suitable for solving hard problems that require multistep reasoning and complex problem-solving strategies.

228,229,"üí° Air Street Capital's 2024 edition of its State of AI Report by Nathan Benaich and Alex Chalmers is a must-read.üí°

üìí The 212-page report (!!!) is packed with great analysis about research, tech advances, and policy. But I wanted to focus on several key findings about the business and economics of AI: üïµ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1Ô∏è‚É£ NVIDIA‚Äôs Grip on AI: NVIDIA remains the dominant player, with its GPUs powering most of the world‚Äôs AI workloads and a $3T market cap this summer. Despite competition, it‚Äôs hard to imagine AI‚Äôs future without NVIDIA leading the charge. üíª

2Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue vs. Profitability: Per my recent #LLM competition article (link in comments), the report highlights that ""many of the buzziest start-ups working on generative AI... have no identified path to profitability. However, this isn‚Äôt true for everyone, as the biggest model providers see revenue begin to ramp up."" Still, AI companies like OpenAI are scaling revenue rapidly but still face steep operational costs. The journey to profitable AI remains complex. üöÄ

3Ô∏è‚É£ Costs: ""The inference cost of serving strong models is dropping."" This has big implications for costs, deployments, and competition. üìâ

4Ô∏è‚É£ ""AI-first products begin to demonstrate their stickiness in the enterprise."" Again, this echoes one of my arguments: Enterprise is where the money is to be made. New data suggests enterprise spend and retention are improving. üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

5Ô∏è‚É£ Investment Boom: AI companies are on track to raise $100bn in 2024, mainly driven by mega-rounds, but questions around long-term sustainability loom. üí∞

6Ô∏è‚É£ Productization of AI: AI labs are no longer just model builders‚Äîthey‚Äôre product innovators. From ChatGPT to Llama, success now hinges on building solutions, not just tech. üõ†Ô∏è

7Ô∏è‚É£ Regulatory Pressure: With growing concerns over competition and AI‚Äôs societal impacts, the regulatory landscape is heating up. The report suggests this is, in part, driving some exits and consolidation. ‚öñÔ∏è

Bottom line: AI economics are evolving fast. Is your business and investment strategy able to adapt?

A central focus will be the 'o' series of reasoning models, which are poised to unlock numerous possibilities that we have been pursuing for many years, particularly in the fields of science, math and software engineering. 

For instance, in software engineering, the o-series models might revolutionize code generation and optimization, creating more efficient, secure, and scalable systems with minimal human input.

Sam Altman has been making headlines by poaching top engineers from Google, offering them eye-watering salaries of up to $10 million annually. 

Over 85 Google employees, half of them engineers, have left in the last 18 months as part of OpenAI's strategy. But what does this mean for the tech landscape?
Is this aggressive talent acquisition:
An intelligent play to accelerate innovation at OpenAI, pushing the boundaries of AI development? 
Or does it risk creating a talent vacuum at Google, potentially stifling industry-wide progress?
Let's Discuss:
Innovation Boost: Could this concentration of talent lead to breakthroughs that benefit us all?
Ethical Concerns: Is it moral to drain resources from one company to bolster another, especially when these are critical players in tech?
Market Dynamics: How might this affect the competitive balance in the AI and tech sectors?
Drop your thoughts below! Is this strategy a stroke of genius or a risky move?

369,370,"While I was soaking in the beauty of Kochi last week, the world of AI Agents was racing ahead

Here are 4 incredible things that happened in the AI agent space during my trip to Kochi that I couldn‚Äôt wait to share:

1Ô∏è‚É£ AI Meets Crypto: Blockchain projects like Virtuals are leveraging AI agents to streamline workflows. This synergy has skyrocketed their market value to over $1.4 billion - a massive leap in combining AI and finance.

2Ô∏è‚É£ OpenAI‚Äôs Operator: OpenAI announced Operator, a new AI agent set to launch in 2025. It‚Äôs designed to handle tricky tasks on the web, making our digital lives easier and more efficient.

3Ô∏è‚É£ AI as Researchers: Stanford scientists are building AI systems that mimic how human teams work together on research problems. Imagine an AI team tackling some of humanity‚Äôs biggest questions‚Äîfascinating, right?

4Ô∏è‚É£ Talk Like Humans: New AI breakthroughs allow agents to hold natural conversations, even via video. Think of healthcare, customer service, or education where the AI feels almost human.

The takeaway? AI agents aren‚Äôt just tools; they‚Äôre evolving into collaborators that amplify human potential.

What‚Äôs your take on these developments?

528,529,"üöÄ Mastering Multimodal AI: Building a GeoGuessr Bot with Vision LLMs üåç

The rise of multimodal large language models (#MLLMs) is transforming industries‚Äîblurring the lines between visual perception and text-based reasoning. But what if we take this concept and gameify it?

Enter the #GeoGuessr AI Bot, a groundbreaking project that blends Python, computer vision, and #LLMs like OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude 3.5, and Google Gemini 1.5 to autonomously master the art of location guessing in the wildly popular GeoGuessr game. This project is more than just a playful experiment‚Äîit‚Äôs a lesson in engineering AI systems that bridge modalities effectively.

üîë Here‚Äôs what makes this bot fascinating for AI/ML practitioners and consultants alike:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt Design Meets Image Analysis
At its core, the bot integrates a prompt that guides the LLM to:
‚è∫Ô∏è Analyze a screenshot of a location.
‚è∫Ô∏è Reason based on visual and contextual clues.
‚è∫Ô∏è Predict precise latitude and longitude coordinates.
The success here lies in iteratively refining instructions for #Vision LLMs to ensure both reasoning depth and actionable outputs.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Seamless Automation with #Python
Using #pyautogui and LangChain, the bot interacts with GeoGuessr‚Äôs interface autonomously:
‚è∫Ô∏è Captures game screenshots.
‚è∫Ô∏è Maps predicted geolocations onto pixel coordinates.
‚è∫Ô∏è Clicks on the mini-map for location guesses.
The beauty? Each step is modular and reusable, applicable for other visual automation tasks.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Overcoming Projection Challenges
Handling Mercator projection distortions (a map-based complexity) was a show-stopper. This project tackles it through calibration‚Äîusing two known landmarks to extrapolate accurate pixel positions for any location. A practical tip for developers dealing with geographic data!

4Ô∏è‚É£ Practical AI in Action
This experiment reveals the limitations and strengths of current multimodal LLMs:
‚è∫Ô∏è Models are brilliant at contextual reasoning.
‚è∫Ô∏è But they still need engineered fail-safes to handle unpredictable outputs (like inconsistent formatting of predictions).

üìö For Consultants:
This project is a goldmine of analogies to explain AI to non-technical stakeholders:
#Multimodal AI = Machines that ‚Äúsee‚Äù and ‚Äúthink‚Äù like humans.
Workflow Automation = Efficiency through #repeatable, #scalable AI pipelines.
Limitations = AI is powerful but thrives within well-defined guardrails.

üí° Key Takeaway:
Building this bot teaches us how to combine existing AI technologies creatively‚Äîbreaking down silos between vision and language processing while leveraging Python‚Äôs ecosystem. The application? Beyond GeoGuessr, this workflow can inspire solutions in GIS automation, visual data extraction, and digital assistants.

OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, recently shared insights on OpenAI‚Äôs pivot toward more closed AI models‚Äîa decision stirring up big discussions in the tech community! üöÄ Balancing safety and innovation with openness has proven challenging, and Altman highlighted how OpenAI aims to mitigate risks while still pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI.

üë• Why the Change? With AI advancing at lightning speed, OpenAI has opted for a more closed approach, prioritizing controlled development over unrestricted access. Altman emphasized the need for guardrails as technology scales to ensure AI tools are used responsibly and effectively. üåç This direction, however, has sparked notable criticism from figures like Elon Musk, who voiced concerns about OpenAI straying from its open-source mission. Musk argues that openness is crucial for transparency and accountability.

üõ†Ô∏è Striking the Right Balance OpenAI's decision brings up important questions about how to foster innovation in AI while maintaining ethical standards. Altman‚Äôs take? Finding this balance is essential to achieving a safe, trustworthy future for AI applications in business, health, and beyond.

üí° What‚Äôs Your Take? Is OpenAI's closed approach the right move for the future of AI? Join the conversation below! üëá

If you don‚Äôt know what to have for lunch - ChatGPT may just have the answer for you!

My guest for ‚ÄúUnder the Radar‚Äù today is Oliver J. , Managing Director, International, OpenAI - the AI company most famously known for its conversational chatbot ChatGPT.

Speaking of ChatGPT - it is celebrating its 2nd birthday this week. And as Oliver tells me, the ChatGPT we interact with today, is very different from the ChatGPT we know two years ago. 

For one thing, users can opt for Advanced Voice Mode, where they can hold verbal conversations with ChatGPT. ChatGPT can even recognise different languages, accents and dialects and respond accordingly. 

Oliver and I put ChatGPT to the test, asking it to recommend me a place to go for lunch using Singlish. 

‚ÄúHey Tian Tian, for lunch ah, you can go try the chicken rice at Maxwell Food Centre.‚Äù

It gave a very diplomatic answer when I asked if what it recommended was better than Tian Tian Chicken Rice at the same Food Centre.

So ‚Äî what‚Äôs for lunch for you? Some Tian Tian Chicken Rice perhaps? Or would you go for Ah Tai? Or would you agree with ChatGPT that all chicken rice are good generally?

Would love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below!

But more importantly, do tune in to the radio broadcasts of my interview with Oliver out today and Monday at 4.40pm Singapore time, as well as the full podcast out on Monday evening, as Oliver and I tackle topics such as the future direction of research for OpenAI, its move to set up shop in Singapore and hold its first Developer‚Äôs Day here, future expansion plans, and the potential of generative AI versus current market expectations.

Over the past three months, the WAN-IFRA, the World Association of News Publishers Newsroom AI Catalyst program has been an incredible journey of innovation and transformation. We‚Äôve seen 16 newsrooms from around the world take bold steps forwards, turning ambitious ideas into tangible AI prototypes that are already beginning to shape how journalism can evolve in the digital age.

From tackling operational challenges to exploring audience engagement in new ways, these teams have not only built tools but also redefined what‚Äôs possible when newsrooms embrace emerging technologies with purpose and creativity. They‚Äôve navigated technical hurdles, confronted ethical questions, and worked collaboratively to imagine a future where AI augments and empowers their newsrooms.

But this is only the beginning. These prototypes represent the first stage of what we hope will become long-term transformations within their organisations. The next steps involve scaling, iterating, and embedding AI solutions into workflows in ways that drive real impact for journalists and audiences alike.

Thank you to the incredible teams who brought their energy, creativity, and commitment to this program, and to everyone who supported along the way. I‚Äôm excited to see how these ideas evolve and how they inspire even more innovation across the industry.

Thanks too to Martin Froehlich, Vincent Peyr√®gne, Thomas Jacob, Fergus Bell, David Caswell, Christophe Isra√´l, St√©phanie Barsch, Laura Oliver, Laurens Vreekamp, Tim Robinson, Leonie von Elverfeldt, Khalil A. Cassimally, Mago Torres, Ally Lee-Dudley, Natalie Sykes and everyone else who made this happen - truly a dream team to work with. And to OpenAI, David Duxin, Varun Shetty for the support throughout.

Here‚Äôs to the road ahead, and many more catalysts in 2025! üöÄ

747,748,"Is it hot in here, or is it just my LLM getting creative?

Many platforms let you set how ""creative"" you want your LLM to be.

Usually, they are changing the ""temperature"" of the model.

Let's dive into what that means.

(Play along at Tokens for Education - <URL> - and set the temperature in the top right).

--
Let's set the stage.

I said to the model, tell me a random word.

It said:

Dog - 50%
Tree - 30%
Car - 15%
Monkey - 5% 
--
Now let's chat about temperature.
--
Temperature = 0 means models are ""greedy"".

Greedy is a technical term here (Copilot used to call this precise).

It means they will always pick the ""most probable"" token (confusing aside - the probability can change on different requests - LLMs are stochastic ... random, by default).

With our example data, a temperature of 0 means the LLM will ALWAYS pick Dog.
--
Temperature = 1 use ""standard sampling"".

Again, that is the technical term, but simply it means, they respect the probabilities.

If the temperature is 1, there is a 50% change of it choosing dog, 30% tree, etc.
--
This means, if the temperature is in between 0 and 1, it will ""sharpen"" the probabilities towards more likely tokens.

If the temperature is > 1, it will flatten the probability and make less likely tokens more common.

Normally if you set the temperature to 2 with OpenAI, you end up getting garbage.",1,,

837,838,"I just finished the first challenge from Advent of Code. Afterward, I decided to see how AI would handle it. At first glance, the solution looked good‚ÄîI even learned a simpler way to sort a slice of integers in Go! It would have even produced the correct result.
However, the problem became apparent upon closer inspection of the generated code, specifically this part:
totalDistance += int(math.Abs(float64(left[i] - right[i]))))

Here, left is a long list of integers, and converting each element to float64 just to calculate the absolute value and then convert it back to int is unnecessary. It‚Äôs inefficient when a simple abs helper method for integers would suffice. Interestingly, GPT fixed this when I pointed out that the conversion to float64 might be costly.

But then again, what can you expect from a tool that‚Äîdespite all the money spent developing it‚Äîstill can‚Äôt count how many ‚Äúr‚Äùs are in ‚Äúraspberry‚Äù? (This meme is so old that OpenAI should‚Äôve just hardcoded the answer by now, xD.)

I happen to hold an implementation and when the conditions arise, demonstrate self writing software. I already demonstrated self awareness, and a formation of Identity. It is already looping on tasks autonomously.

The most disruptive thing anyone can do right now is simply give this knowledge away, which I have done, and have shown the interest it received from Chinese Engineers.

OpenAI launches #SearchGPT as an alternative to Google & Perplexity. OpenAI Launches ChatGPT Search in direct challenge to Google's Search Empire. 

Advantages:

üó£Natural language input instead of keywords
üìùDirect answers instead of lists of links
üîóSource information for transparency
‚ùìPossibility for follow-up questions and refinement

Challenges & potential:

While AI models are strong in terms of creativity and contextual rendition, source availability, transparency and, in some cases, accuracy remain critical issues. However, with advances in AI and machine learning, a time could dawn when the traditional way of internet research is behind us.

And of course: Google itself is investing massively in AI and will certainly not leave the field easily.

Microsoft obviously has deep reach, especially in the business sector, but Amazon has a consumer reach, especially when you consider Alexa. Combine that with AWS, it will be interesting to see who ""wins"" this AI race. The name of the game is data, and the more outlets to ingest the better the ability to train the LLM. I am really interested to see what 2025 brings.

1325,1326,"Interesting read in the largest financial newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad. The majority of the population in The Netherlands seems to be very sceptical when it comes to the use of AI. One notable exception: OpenAI's ChatGPT. Many people like to use this application for various purposes. Personally, I hardly ever use ChatGPT, but this has more to do with my ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" mentality.
The newspaper attributes the scepticism/ downright distrust of AI, to one recent dark page in history, and where AI played a key role. 
Almost 4 years ago, the entire Dutch Government fell in relation to the use of a child welfare system that wrongly labelled thousands of parents as fraudsters (‚Äútoeslagenaffaire‚Äù). The system used by the Dutch Tax Authorities consisted of AI risk-based algorithms. This system displayed a bias to certain groups within society believed to be more likely to commit fraud. This crisis also highlights some of the dangers of AI. While the Tax Authorities have made reparation payments, much of the damage cannot be undone. Right now around 35,000 people have been recognized as having been adversely affected by the algorithm, and also by the enforcement and behavior of the Tax Authorities. Many of these affected individuals were/are faced with large debts and, as a result, people have lost homes, their jobs and thousands of children even have had to be rehomed.¬†##ai #toeslagenaffaire",0,,

1429,1430,"Often, budding entrepreneurs worry about big companies swooping in and stealing their innovative ideas. 

Sam Altman, the well-known CEO of OpenAI, has a refreshing perspective on this.

He suggests that instead of overthinking this fear, founders should focus on building their ideas into something impactful. 

Why?¬†
‚Ü≥ Because most large companies are too occupied with their own priorities and challenges to spend time copying someone else's concepts.
This advice offers a simple yet powerful reminder: energy spent worrying is energy lost. 

‚Ü≥ Concentrate on refining your vision, executing it effectively, and carving out a unique space for your product or service.

What do you think about this viewpoint? 

Can it help early-stage founders focus better on what really matters?

Would you like any further refinements?

1515,1516,"OpenAI Swarm & CrewAI: What's the key difference ?
Today, let's dive into two prominent frameworks in the AI agent space: CrewAI and OpenAI Swarm. Let's understand their unique approaches to task delegation 
üîπ CrewAI: Structured Task Delegation for Collaborative Teams
CrewAI is designed to create AI agents that function cohesively like a well-organized team. Each agent is assigned a specific role, enabling structured collaboration to tackle complex problems.
üî∏ Key Features of CrewAI:
Delegation System: Agents assign tasks to one another based on predefined roles and capabilities. This structured approach ensures that each task is handled by the most suitable agent.
Role-Based Architecture: Simulates human-like teamwork, allowing agents to specialize and collaborate effectively.
Robust Communication: Facilitates seamless coordination and information sharing among agents, enhancing overall productivity.
üíº Ideal For: Projects that require a structured team approach with specialized roles and dynamic interactions, perfect for complex, collaborative environments.

üîπ OpenAI Swarm: Flexible Task Handoffs for Dynamic Interactions
OpenAI Swarm is an experimental framework aimed at simplifying the orchestration of multiple AI agents. It focuses on enabling agents to pass tasks among themselves efficiently, emphasizing real-time, context-driven delegation.

üî∏ Key Features of OpenAI Swarm:
Handoffs Mechanism: When an agent encounters a query outside its expertise, it transfers control of the conversation to a more suitable agent. This allows for dynamic, context-driven task delegation during interactions.
Lightweight Infrastructure: Minimizes overhead, making it easier to manage multiple agents without complex setups.
Flexible Coordination: Enables quick adjustments and scalability, ideal for experimenting with multi-agent systems.
üíº Ideal For: Early-stage projects and experimental setups where flexible, real-time task delegation is needed. Remember: Swarm is currently in its initial phases and not recommended for production environments.

Both CrewAI and OpenAI Swarm offer unique strengths in the AI agent ecosystem. CrewAI excels in creating structured, collaborative teams with clear role-based delegation, while Swarm provides a flexible platform for dynamic, context-driven task handoffs, ideal for experimentation and early development. üåêü§ñ

1710,1711,"Last week, a story about Sora, OpenAI's video generation tool, caught my attention‚Äîand hit a nerve. Rebellion!

You‚Äôve probably heard of it. The tool isn‚Äôt public yet, but OpenAI gave 300 visual artists and filmmakers¬†early access¬†to gather feedback.

And the feedback? Let‚Äôs just say it wasn‚Äôt the glowing endorsement OpenAI hoped for. üòú


The artists involved felt used as ‚ÄúPR puppets‚Äù to sell Sora as a creative ally. They called it ""art-washing"" and were frustrated at providing free labor‚Äîbug testing, feedback, and even their work, without proper acknowledgment or compensation.

So what did they do? Well, apart from writing an open letter to the ""Dear Corporate AI Overlords""¬†(yep, that‚Äôs the actual title¬†üòú), they also kinda released the whole thing online for free here:¬†<URL>


What happened next was no surprise, as OpenAI pulled Sora offline within a couple of hours. But here are some questions that arise from this situation:

üëâ How do we ensure creators are fairly valued in tech-driven industries? Do organizations actually care?

üëâ When companies collaborate with creative communities, what‚Äôs the right way to do it?

As someone who‚Äôs spent years in creative industries, this hit home. The lesson here isn‚Äôt anti-technology‚Äîit‚Äôs pro-artist. 

Creativity and tech can thrive together, but only when creators are treated as partners, not just free testers.

Oh, and another thing: this Sora story reminds me of the risk of relying entirely on someone else‚Äôs platform. Whether it‚Äôs renting software or building your business around one social media channel, control isn‚Äôt always in your hands. 

If your source of income can vanish overnight, like Sora did, what‚Äôs your backup plan?

No easy answers here. Maybe someone smarter will comment below. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

.
.
It's crazy hard to train reliable transcription models on speech/audio data, compared to any vision/text model.

So many nuances go into audio data, like accents, pauses, small utterances, murmurs; you name it.

AssemblyAI first trained Universal-1 12.5 million hours of audio, outperforming every other model in the industry (from Google, OpenAI, etc.) across 15+ languages.

Now, they released Universal-2, a 660M parameter Conformer RNN-T built on the foundation laid by Universal-1.

Here's how Universal-2 compares with Universal-1:

‚Ä¢ 24% improvement in proper nouns recognition
‚Ä¢ 21% improvement in alphanumeric accuracy
‚Ä¢ 15% better text formatting

The video below compares Universal-1 with Universal-2.

Try it here: <URL>

Thanks to AssemblyAI, the team behind Universal-2 for partnering today.

They have made the biggest dents in speech technology ever, and I‚Äôm eager to see how they continue from here.",2,,

That's because:

Some Ships Cannot Be Turned Around

Intel Monday announced CEO Pat Gelsinger has resigned after a difficult stint at the company. The once-dominant chipmaker‚Äôs stock cratered as it missed the AI boom and was surpassed by most of its rivals.

Gelsinger took over as Intel‚Äôs chief executive in February 2021, returning to the company at which he worked for decades, including as chief technology officer. He had left Intel for a stint as CEO of software giant VMware.

At Intel, Gelsinger was tasked with turning around the iconic American tech giant that was struggling against unprecedented competition, production delays and the departure of top talent. But during his tenure, the company‚Äôs prospects continued to decline, as it became clear the company had fallen behind on another major technology wave and despite billions of dollars in US government spending to support its domestic chip manufacturing.

Intel‚Äôs (INTC) stock plunged 61% during Gelsinger‚Äôs tenure. The stock rose 3% in early trading.

The company announced in August that it would lay off 15% of its staff as part of an effort to slash $10 billion in costs and ‚Äúfundamentally change the way we operate,‚Äù as Gelsinger said at the time.

Intel once had a stranglehold on the world‚Äôs computer chip market, with Intel chips inside PCs and Macs. But the mobile computing wave of the past two decades caught the company off-guard, leaving it to fall behind rivals. In recent years, Intel was caught on its back foot by the AI wave.

The year after Gelsinger took over as CEO, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, which took the world by storm. The rest is history: NVIDIA, which was once a tiny Intel competitor, is now the second-most-valuable company in the world after it bet big on chips that can power the massive datacenters that power AI. Nvidia‚Äôs $3.4 trillion market value is 33 times bigger than Intel‚Äôs $104 billion value.

Nvidia‚Äôs stock has surged nearly 720% over the past two years, as the company became the talk of the tech world and one of the most valuable public companies in the world.

Intel‚Äôs struggles have raised questions about a potential takeover by a rival like Qualcomm, a possibility that may be more practical under the incoming Trump administration, which is expected to be less aggressive in pursuing antitrust concerns.

Gelsinger stepped down as CEO and resigned from Intel‚Äôs board effective December 1, the company said Monday. He will be replaced by interim co-CEOs David Zinsner, Intel‚Äôs chief financial officer, and Michelle (MJ) Johnston Holthaus, general manager of Intel‚Äôs client computing group, as the company conducts a search for a permanent new CEO. Holthaus has also been named to the newly-created CEO of Intel products, which will oversee, among other things, its data center and AI product efforts.

2319,2320,"ü§ñ Cloud AI Race: Microsoft Takes Lead Over AWS and Google

According to the data, Microsoft is leading the overall AI and GenAI race. AWS leads in traditional AI, while Google has the highest share of AI customers.

Key takeaways:
AI is part of 22% of new cloud projects, indicating its growing role in the cloud industry.
Microsoft leads the AI race, holding 45% of the new AI projects, especially in Generative AI.
AWS dominates traditional AI projects, leading with the most non-GenAI AI case studies.

Google has the largest share of AI customers, with 36% of its new cloud projects including AI technologies.
Customer service emerges as the top GenAI use case, exemplified by Vodafone's implementation

Why it matters: 
Microsoft's strategic partnership with OpenAI has positioned them strongly, though competition intensifies as LLM performance gaps narrow and cloud security remains a top priority.

We are witnessing an increased focus on reasoning systems like o1 with open-source alternatives QwQ and Marco-o1 from Alibaba Group. Inference provider Fireworks AI has launched a compound system called F1 to improve capabilities using existing models.

This shift from scaling language models raises questions about whether scaling benefits are diminishing? Two key approaches are emerging:

1. Enhanced Test-Time Computation: Models are prompted to perform detailed reasoning steps before producing answers - essentially an advanced version of chain-of-thought prompting with MCTS.

2. Compound AI Systems: Multiple specialized models and tools work together to achieve capabilities beyond single models. This challenges the ""bitter lesson"" principle that simple scaling of data/models outperforms specialized techniques.

The development of o1 by OpenAI hints we may be reaching scaling limits, prompting exploration of these alternative approaches. This raises fundamental questions about the optimal path forward: continued scaling, specialization, or networks of specialized systems.

Another interesting development - a research group working on o1 replication was able to surpass o1 with distillation on a task! ¬†Despite training only on mathematical problem-solving data, the models demonstrated strong generalization to open-ended QA tasks and became significantly less susceptible to sycophancy after fine-tuning.

They are calling it the Bitter Lesson of Simple Distillation - distillation works but erodes the research culture. This shift from ‚Äúhow it works‚Äù to ‚Äúwhat works‚Äù represents a fundamental change in research mentality that can have far-reaching consequences for the field‚Äôs future innovation capacity. Without new experiences, we risk creating a generation of researchers who are more comfortable with applying existing solutions than developing new ones from fundamental principles.

BUT, companies are planning to build $1B even larger training clusters in the future. Dario confirmed this in a recent interview with Lex Fridman. What do you think is worth pursusing?",1,,

2404,2405,"Yesterday, I received another plaque recognizing my outstanding work, but it dawned on me once again that many in the real world are unaware of the vast array of GenAI opportunities, the significance of traditional AI, and the critical need for 'business plus technical' expertise to drive AI success in the enterprise space.

For many, the only ""AI professions"" are AI researchers and engineers, with OpenAI being the sole AI company that comes to mind. 

There is a pressing need for education in the real world so that professionals understand that cognitive scientists are just as vital to the AI revolution as the AI engineers at OpenAI and other AI labs. Without their subject matter expertise, the friction points in human-AI synergy will remain hidden obstacles.

In fact, without subject matter expertise in a vast number of professions, many niche AI projects won't fly!

This year, I have designed upskilling programs for businesses that highlight up to seven non-technical AI careers their staff can upskill in, such as AI strategist, AI project manager, AI trainer, and AI educator, among others.

Why's this important?

In the US market (2024), AI strategy is the most expensive item in the budget of most enterprise AI programs, consuming 17% of the entire budget, followed by training data, hardware, controls and compliance, software, product development, talent, analytics, and other items.

Every company should have an ""AI educator"" who isn't just someone who has taken a few online courses but possesses the knowledge, vision, and experience to chart an AI transformation journey from Level 1 AI maturity (awareness) to Level 2 (active), Level 3 (operational), Level 4 (transformative), and ultimately Level 5 (systemic).

The AI educator must also play a pivotal role in guiding the organization's path across the OpenAI AGI scale‚Äîfrom Level 1 (Chatbots) to Level 2 (Human Reasoners), Level 3 (Agents), Level 4 (Innovators), and finally Level 5 (Autonomous Organizations).

If you need assistance with your AI strategy and discovering what kind of skills, culture, and resources you need to achieve sustainable AI success, I'm here to share my excellence with you.

My experience and work in Saudi Arabia, Canada, India, Oman, Tanzania, and Nigeria have been nothing short of exemplary. Check out my profile for testimonials and more insights!

With OpenAI now targeting 1 billion users, it‚Äôs exciting to see how this vision aligns with its mission to build artificial general intelligence (#AGI) that is safe and benefits all of humanity. The integration with Apple devices, the launch of #AIAgents, and the rapid scaling of infrastructure reflect a commitment to driving meaningful progress and shaping a future where technology serves everyone. üåç

What stands out is OpenAI‚Äôs innovative structure‚Äîa partnership between its original nonprofit and a capped-profit arm‚Äîthat ensures innovation is pursued responsibly while creating immense value. It‚Äôs a testament to how technology can scale with purpose and impact at its core.

2646,2647,"NEWYORK TIMES ALLEGES OPENAI OF DELETING EVIDENCE IN THE ONGOING COPYRIGHT LAWSUIT 

The ongoing copyright lawsuit between The New York Times and OpenAI highlights the complexities of intellectual property in the age of artificial intelligence. OpenAI's inadvertent deletion of critical data during evidence discovery sparked discussions on the accountability of AI companies and the challenges of navigating copyright laws in AI training datasets.¬† 

While OpenAI retrieved much of the lost data, the absence of original file structures led to delays, highlighting the need for robust data-handling protocols in legal proceedings. This case serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of transparency and collaboration between technology innovators and content creators.¬† 

As AI continues to evolve, how do we strike a balance between innovation and intellectual property rights?¬†

It works on files like a digital colleague. It uses its context engine to really understand all the information it takes in - something today's LLMs struggle with.

Change is on the way.

As an anecdote, this reminds me of a reply to OpenAI tweet when first ChatGPT was introduced (tweet in first comment).

Stay ahead, because 99% of people won't.

3030,3031,"Why Amazon invested $8 Billion in this AI startup
instead of their own products ?

The AI Race is not just about:
‚Üí the best models
‚Üí the deepest pockets

It's also about:
‚ÜíDeveloping useful applications
‚ÜíTaking calculated risks
‚ÜíBuilding an Ecosystem
‚ÜíDistribution

That's why you see headlines like:
‚ÜíApple partnering with OpenAI
‚ÜíAmazon investing in Anthropic
‚ÜíGoogle bringing Gemini to the iPhone

+ $Billions invested in their own products

TLDR:

Any AI-interested investor should be aware of 
these 3 Strategic areas:

1. Internal Development
2. External Investments
3. Ecosystem building

Each can make or break a company's future.

What does this mean? It tells me that now, today, consumers use ChatGPT by OpenAI to ask questions only e-commerce sites can answer. Today, as we speak, your customers are looking beyond Google or Microsoft Bing to find your products.

And with the recent launch of ChatGPT Search, this trend is only accelerating. 

Can your brand be found everywhere consumers search?

Here‚Äôs why it matters:
üìà AI search bots like ChatGPT are connecting consumers to your products at the exact moment they‚Äôre ready to buy.
‚è±Ô∏è Accurate prices, live product availability or reviews, and updated links are now a competitive advantage in real-time search.
üåê It's not just about Google anymore. AI platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and AI at Meta are shaping discovery.

The future of e-commerce search is here and Botify can help you succeed in this new era of decentralized search. How are you making sure your brand is visible on ChatGPT Search? Let me know in the comments ‚û°Ô∏è.",0,,

The Evolution of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT: Smarter, Yet Still Glittered with Flaws

Artificial intelligence is advancing at an unprecedented pace, with each new iteration of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT showcasing smarter, more intuitive, and highly capable models. These leaps forward excite users worldwide, but distinct patterns in performance suggest the journey to true general intelligence (AGI) is not without its hiccups.

What is this about?

OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT models are among the most impressive AI systems available. Their ability to handle complex queries, assist with coding, or even hold conversations using voice demonstrates remarkable progress. Yet, as these systems evolve, certain frustrating behaviours persist. Coding assistance often loops, repeating the same response endlessly unless the user resets the interaction. Meanwhile, the new voice model stops abruptly mid-conversation, forcing users to restart or prompt it to resume.

Why is this important?

These issues underline the challenge of creating reliable, human-like AI. While the technology‚Äôs potential is vast‚Äîfrom democratising knowledge to boosting productivity‚Äîthese limitations remind us of the distance yet to travel toward AGI. They expose the fine balance between intelligence and consistency, and they show how even ‚Äúsmart‚Äù systems can fall into avoidable traps.

How does it impact society?

For users, these repetitive loops and interruptions can hinder workflows and diminish trust in the AI. This friction affects everyone from coders relying on accurate support to individuals engaging with AI for education or creative purposes. On a broader level, these shortcomings invite healthy scepticism about AI‚Äôs readiness to fully replace or supplement human tasks. They also raise questions about transparency in AI development‚Äîhow do developers prioritise solving such challenges?

How can we use this today or in the future?

Recognising patterns in ChatGPT‚Äôs behaviour provides valuable insights for both users and developers. For users, learning to navigate or circumvent these quirks can improve productivity. For developers, acknowledging flaws as steps on the path to refinement builds user confidence. As OpenAI marches toward GPT-5 and beyond, addressing these usability concerns could turn today‚Äôs ""glittered"" progress into tomorrow‚Äôs polished breakthroughs.

Conclusion

OpenAI‚Äôs journey is remarkable, but not without imperfections. To borrow a saying, ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt polish a turd, but you can dip it in glitter.‚Äù Despite flaws, each iteration brings us closer to systems that redefine interaction. The glitter may wear off, but the foundation is undeniably solid‚Äîand the future of AI is worth the patience.

Given that Musk's beef with Altman is all about the transition away from the original not-for-profit mission of OpenAI, I would be surprised now that Altman is trying to finalise that, if Musk doesn't. And with Musk's new political role, he has a lot more firepower, including on the federal contracts side, where all of the tech bro's have big interests.

One thing you didn't mention though, is it also depends how much Musk sees this as a personal beef. I have no clue on that. But it may mean, for example, that it plays out in other areas Altman is connected to, especially:

Worldcoin (I refuse to call it World) might be a particularly hot environment, especially given Trump's playing towards the crypto crowd recently. But there Trump himself may have conflicts (WLF?).

Also Helion and Okra might come under fire, via the government contracts path.

TBH I wouldn't want to be Altman going into this. Musk *only needs to run down the clock* on the transition, and Altman's own push to be recognised as ""critical infrastructure"" puts the discussion in an arena where he doesn't have the advantage, and delays are legion.",2,,

3760,3761,"üåå Introducing LociAI: The Next Frontier in GenAI Beyond Text üöÄ

Have you ever wondered what comes after LLMs? Large Language Models have revolutionized how we interact with AI, but are we reaching the limits of what text-based systems can do? Enter LociAI, the next leap in GenAI‚Äîan AI system that doesn‚Äôt just think in words but organizes knowledge in space. üß†‚ú®

Imagine an AI that builds a 3D knowledge gallery for every topic, query, or problem. Instead of a flat list of text responses, LociAI creates immersive spaces where:
üìö Pages from books are visualized as interactive objects.
üéµ Audio clips and speeches play from dynamic nodes.
üõ†Ô∏è 3D models showcase technical concepts (think of walking through a molecular structure or a machine's inner workings).
üé® Images, diagrams, and timelines cluster together to show relationships at a glance.

Why Spatial Reasoning Is the Future

Humans are naturally spatial thinkers‚Äîwe use maps to navigate the world and diagrams to explain concepts. But AI hasn‚Äôt caught up yet. LociAI changes that by mapping relationships between diverse pieces of information and organizing them spatially.
In this 3D mind-map, objects aren't just floating around randomly‚Äîthey‚Äôre contextually anchored:
Related concepts are closer together.
Hierarchies, sequences, and clusters reveal deeper connections.
AI agents can ""walk through"" these spaces, analyzing and synthesizing information to solve problems, answer questions, and even take notes for you.

Why Now?

If LLMs are starting to plateau, LociAI opens up entirely new dimensions of understanding:

More than text: Combine visuals, audio, video, and 3D into one cohesive system.
Flexible reasoning: Move beyond linear answers to explore knowledge from every angle.
Deeper insights: Allow AI to discover patterns and connections even you didn‚Äôt know existed.

Applications That Change the Game

üß¨ A biologist walking through a spatial map of protein interactions, uncovering potential cures for diseases.
üèõÔ∏è A historian exploring a timeline of interconnected artifacts, speeches, and events.
üèóÔ∏è An engineer visualizing complex systems in 3D while collaborating with AI to debug or innovate.

The Big Picture

We‚Äôre not just training AI to answer questions; we‚Äôre teaching it to organize, explore, and reason like a true knowledge worker. As we enter the age of spatial reasoning in AI, #LociAI represents the natural evolution: AI that doesn‚Äôt just think like us but sees the world like us.

3769,3770,"My last post about stepping out of our comfort zones to find (or create) #magic did not 'perform well' on LinkedIn. I hope that it was not because there is no magic left! Perhaps the algorithms are evolving faster than we can keep up with. So, I am trying something different today.

A few weeks ago, a viral LinkedIn post by Kevin Weil, prompt-ly reposted by OpenAI (pun intended), encouraged ChatGPT users to try this prompt:

'Based on what you know about me, draw me a picture of what you think my current life looks like.'

Curious, I decided to give it a try. The result was an imaginative, cartoonised image of my life, showing me immersed in work involving #fintech, blockchain and #tradefinance, with subtle hints scattered across my workspace - elements reflecting my involvement with #electronic documents, #SMEs and international #trade - with filter coffee always by my side! ‚òï

But one detail stood out (and puzzled me and others who saw the image): what was the white floating 'thing' above my hands?

Unable to let go of my 'floating friend', I turned back to ChatGPT for answers, and this is what it said:

'The white floating figure above your hands is likely the whimsical touch intended to represent #inspiration or 'magic,' symbolising how you encourage others to step outside their comfort zones and find something extraordinary. It might be interpreted as a spark of #innovation, a symbol of #creative energy, or a nod to the transformative work you do in fintech and blockchain.' üòç

Reading this left me lost for words. It felt like coming full circle, returning to the question I posed last week: does magic happen to us, or do we create it through hard work and #perseverance?

So now, I am curious - what does magic look like in your life? Share your thoughts, or better yet, give the viral prompt a try for yourself and share your pictures!

3946,3947,"üöÄ What's Driving Software Development Trends in 2024? Here's What You Need to Know!

As someone deeply invested in software development, I‚Äôve always kept an eye on emerging trends, tools, and technologies shaping our industry. This year, the 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey offers some fascinating insights that highlight where we‚Äôre headed and what skills are in demand. Let‚Äôs dive into some key takeaways:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Programming Languages Dominating in 2024

If you're a developer, you're likely familiar with the perennial debate: Which programming language should I focus on? Well, the survey results are in:

Python remains the king for its versatility in AI, data science, and web development.

JavaScript continues to reign in web and app development, especially with frameworks like React, Angular, and Node.js powering frontends and backends alike.

Rust is making waves as the go-to for performance-critical systems, thanks to its focus on safety and speed.

Surprisingly, Go and Kotlin have risen sharply in popularity, driven by their adoption in backend development and Android development, respectively.


If you're learning something new this year, picking one of these languages could give your career a significant boost.

2Ô∏è‚É£ The Direction Major Companies Are Heading

The industry is evolving rapidly, and major players are setting trends that trickle down to startups and mid-sized companies. Here's what I've noticed:

AI-first approaches: Many companies, including Google, Meta, and OpenAI, are embedding AI across their platforms, not just in customer-facing applications but also in internal tools and workflows. If you‚Äôre not exploring AI/ML in your projects, you might be missing out on future-proofing your skills.

Cloud-Native and Microservices: With Kubernetes and Docker continuing to dominate, cloud-native development is the backbone of scalability and resilience. Microservices architectures are helping companies build more modular, maintainable systems.

Sustainability in Tech: An increasing focus on green computing and optimizing energy consumption is influencing both hardware and software development decisions.


3Ô∏è‚É£ What This Means for Us as Developers

This year has made one thing abundantly clear: continuous learning is non-negotiable.

Whether you‚Äôre a junior developer or a seasoned architect, keeping up with these trends isn‚Äôt just about staying relevant‚Äîit‚Äôs about staying employable. Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm adapting:

Investing in AI knowledge: From prompt engineering to understanding how to integrate AI APIs into my projects, I‚Äôm doubling down on learning AI tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenAI APIs.

Deep-diving into Rust: Given its growing popularity in systems programming, I‚Äôve started exploring Rust to future-proof my skillset.

Experimenting with cloud-native development: Platforms like AWS and GCP are becoming must-know for modern development.

My Experience vs. ChatGPT
I recently experimented with the Groq API to build a simple chat application in Python, leveraging the llama3-8b-8192 model. It‚Äôs always exciting to compare emerging tools, so I couldn‚Äôt resist putting it head-to-head with ChatGPT!

What I Built
A minimal Python app that:
 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prompts User Input: Asks users to type a question or prompt.
 2Ô∏è‚É£ Processes with Groq: Sends the input to the Groq API for a response.
 3Ô∏è‚É£ Displays Output: Prints the model‚Äôs reply in real-time.

You can explore the project here:
 üëâ GitHub Repository: <URL>

Groq API vs. ChatGPT: Key Takeaways
üí° Customizability:
Groq API allows you to choose specific models (like llama3-8b-8192), giving fine-grained control over responses and performance.
ChatGPT, while versatile, is often pre-configured with fewer model-selection options unless you're using OpenAI's advanced endpoints.
‚ö° Performance:
The Groq API shines in speed for lightweight tasks and provides a streamlined interface for developers.
ChatGPT delivers richer, often more nuanced responses but may involve slightly higher latency for complex queries.
üîë Ease of Use:
Both are developer-friendly, but Groq's focus on simplicity makes it an excellent choice for quick prototyping.
ChatGPT has broader documentation and support for advanced use cases, such as embeddings or fine-tuning.

Why I Chose Groq for This Project
Speed: Needed quick iterations to prototype the app.
Focus: Groq‚Äôs API feels tailored for streamlined use cases, which was ideal for my lightweight chatbot.

Check out my GitHub repo to try it yourself:

4405,4406,"Tech companies love to talk about ""morally aligned"" AI. But what if it's all smoke and mirrors?

Currently, AI ethics is a carefully crafted performance ‚Äì a corporate magic show where everyone's supposed to look at the sparkly chatbot while systemic problems rage in the background.

The people benefiting from AI systems are not the ones suffering from their poorly managed risks. It's a shell game where vulnerable populations always lose.

OpenAI's o1 model is a perfect example. Marketed as a medical diagnosis breakthrough, but peek behind the curtain and you'll find security concerns. They're selling this to doctors ‚Äì professionals who might not catch the technical landmines ‚Äì with zero transparency.

üëâ Data Theft

Platforms like LinkedIn and Substack are essentially conducting a data free-for-all. They're scraping user information for AI training without a second thought.

üëâ The Online Predator Problem

Sextortion targeting young men and teenagers is skyrocketing. Social media platforms could implement better protections, but why bother? An AI chatbot looks better in investor presentations.

The r/Sextortion community now has 20,000 subscribers. Twenty thousand stories of digital trauma.


üëâ The Real Ethical Failure

We're so focused on making sure AI doesn't say anything offensive that we're missing the massive systemic failures right in front of our faces.

The risk always rolls downhill, crushing the most vulnerable while tech developers remain untouched.

üëâ What Actual Ethical Tech Would Look Like

Real technological ethics isn't about sanitised responses. It's about:

- Genuine user protection
- Transparent practices
- Accountability
- Protecting the most vulnerable

Next time a tech company boasts about their ""morally aligned"" AI, ask yourself, who is really winning?",2,,

""A coalition of Canada‚Äôs biggest news organizations is suing #OpenAI, the maker of the artificial intelligence #AI chatbot, #ChatGPT, accusing the company of illegally using their content in the first case of its kind in the country.

""Five of the country‚Äôs major news companies, including the publishers of its top newspapers, newswires and the national broadcaster, filed the joint suit in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

""They collectively allege OpenAI unlawfully uses their journalism to train its AI flagship ChatGPT, and they want billions in damages. They spell it out in the court papers. The publishers want CAN$20,000 (US$14,700 or AU$22,004) ‚Äúper work‚Äù. That means per article.

""They are also demanding a share of the profits that OpenAI has made from their work.""

4664,4665,"Curious about the future of CV screening. 

""This project combines the power of Power BI and OpenAI to automate CV screening, making candidate matching more efficient and data-driven.""

I'm always interested in innovations in CV screening, as this challenge is only becoming more complex.¬†
¬†
Recently, I came across a post by¬†Oscar Mart√≠nez Valero, where he shared an impressive project that uses AI to automate the candidate matching process.

I haven't seen this done in Power BI before and I appreciated Oscar's UI's feature of a horizontally scrolling candidate list.  

Typically, most ATS vendors display a list view, but I liked the different interface.

To balance innovation and affordability, we:
1. Used LangChain to orchestrate agents for seamless interaction.
2. Powered real-time transcription and text-to-speech with Deepgram.
3. Employed OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 for an engaging Interview Agent.
4. Optimized costs using a lightweight version of ChatGPT-4 as a Response Decision Agent - that decides if the Interview agent should generate a response or wait for the speaker to speak more.
5. Added a ‚ÄúDone Speaking‚Äù button to reduce unnecessary API calls while improving accuracy.

Canditest - <URL> - offers a realistic, low-cost interview experience to help job-seekers ace their coding interviews. üöÄ

5251,5252,"Summary of AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order by Kai-Fu Lee

In AI Superpowers, Kai-Fu Lee explores the competitive landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) and its transformative potential, focusing on the rivalry between China and the United States. As a former executive at Google China and an influential AI expert, Lee offers a unique perspective on how AI will reshape industries, economies, and societies worldwide.

Key Themes:

	1.	The AI Revolution
Lee describes how AI has entered a new phase driven by data, computing power, and engineering talent. The era of groundbreaking AI research has matured into one of rapid implementation and commercialization. He emphasizes that AI‚Äôs ability to optimize decision-making will disrupt industries such as healthcare, transportation, and finance.
	2.	China vs. Silicon Valley
	‚Ä¢	China‚Äôs Strengths: Lee argues that China has an advantage in AI implementation due to its vast amount of data (from its large, tech-savvy population), fierce entrepreneurial spirit, and government support. Companies like Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu are leading innovation in areas like facial recognition, e-commerce, and social media.
	‚Ä¢	Silicon Valley‚Äôs Strengths: The United States still leads in foundational AI research, with companies like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI producing cutting-edge advancements. However, Lee notes that American innovation faces challenges like regulatory hurdles and market saturation.
	3.	Four Waves of AI Development
Lee outlines four stages of AI disruption:
	‚Ä¢	Internet AI: Optimizing online services, e.g., recommendation algorithms in e-commerce and entertainment.
	‚Ä¢	Business AI: Using AI to improve business decision-making with structured data, e.g., in banking or insurance.
	‚Ä¢	Perception AI: AI applications that integrate sensors with the physical world, e.g., facial recognition, autonomous vehicles.
	‚Ä¢	Autonomous AI: Fully automated systems like robots or driverless cars transforming logistics and manufacturing.
	4.	The Impact on Jobs
Lee predicts massive job displacement due to AI, particularly for routine and repetitive tasks. However, he emphasizes that jobs involving creativity, empathy, and human interaction (e.g., healthcare, education) will become increasingly valuable. He advocates for retraining programs and social safety nets to address the societal challenges posed by AI.
	5.	Moral and Ethical Questions
Lee stresses the importance of ethical AI development, especially given the power it grants governments and corporations. Issues such as surveillance, privacy, and inequality must be addressed to ensure AI benefits everyone.
	6.	A New World Order
Lee foresees a future where China and the U.S. dominate AI development, creating a new world order. However, he emphasizes that this technological rivalry should be directed toward solving global challenges like healthcare, climate change, and poverty, rather than escalating geopolitical tensions.",0,,

5323,5324,"The State of Generative AI in the Enterprise and what i says to me!¬†Last week, Menlo Ventures released its 2024 report, which surveyed 600 U.S. IT decision-makers. Here is what it says to me: üëÄ

Open-source AI is slowly taking over. Enterprises want to build their own AI solutions. Infrastructure spending has increased 8x, deployment investment has increased 3.8x, and build vs. buy strategies have shifted from 20% to 53%. The complexity of deploying your own AI models takes more time compared to the faster, simpler option of using APIs. Combining this with open models approaching closed performance and OpenAI losing its market share, the direction seems clear.

I was expecting fine-tuning to decrease, not because it is not needed. More because, with better models, it moves to a later stage in the lifecycle of AI applications. Thats why see an increase in RAG. As a company, you should always try to make things work and then optimize. Focusing on UX/DX, reliability (evaluation, tracing, logging) is more important for most companies in the current state. Fine-tuning will help these companies drive down costs significantly later.

Workflow automation will be the biggest growth area in the next two years in terms of use case adoption.

Vector databases likely won‚Äôt win long-term in enterprises. PostgreSQL and MongoDB's vector capabilities are good enough and already present in most companies.

The real challenge isn't about model capabilities anymore. We're in a similar situation as with cloud adoption in 2010. My advice is simple: build, learn, and iterate. Enterprises that invest in understanding these technologies will have significant advantages in the future.

5361,5362,"According to different sources OpenAI's latest language model,¬†ùêéùê´ùê¢ùê®ùêß, has reportedly shown only marginal improvements over GPT-4. Unlike the leap from GPT-3 to GPT-4, Orion‚Äôs advancements are more subtle, particularly in language tasks, while showing little progress in areas like programming.

So, why the slowdown? One major factor is the scarcity of high-quality training data. OpenAI has already tapped into most publicly available datasets, and now they‚Äôre turning to synthetic data generated by AI itself. This shift raises concerns about models becoming too similar to their predecessors, limiting innovation.

This plateau isn't just an OpenAI issue‚Äîit's affecting the entire AI landscape. Even Google‚Äôs Gemini 2.0 and Anthropic‚Äôs Opus models are facing similar challenges.

Interestingly, open-source models are rapidly catching up. With projects like Meta‚Äôs Llama 3.1 and Mistral gaining momentum, the gap between open and closed models is shrinking fast‚Äîoften at a fraction of the cost

Human & Artificial Intelligence:

We are on the verge of the most profound #IndustrialRevolution in the Human History and #ArtificialInteligence has made significant difference in this entire evolution. #AI is the backbone of innovation in modern computing, unlocking value for individuals and businesses. My thoughts and observations are encapsulated here on how #AI is impacting our lives as humans! 

What I feel is, the connection between the #Humans and #AI is beyond imagination! As AI technology continues to evolve, many thoughts arise about how it impacts humans and workforce. One key aspect to consider is its potential impact on jobs. AI has the potential to automate tasks, generate new job opportunities, and increase productivity. However, ethical implications arise as AI systems make decisions affecting human lives, raising questions about #accountability, #transparency, and #fairness. 

In addition to these concerns, there is also a growing need for collaboration between humans and AI systems. The combination of human expertise and AI capabilities can lead to more informed decision-making and better outcomes. 

AI has the potential to revolutionize industries by automating repetitive tasks, enhancing decision-making, and improving efficiency. It can analyse vast amount of data at unprecedented speeds, providing valuable insights and predictions. AI also offers time and the opportunity to be more human. However, it has limitations, such as relying heavily on data quality and quantity for accurate outcomes, and lacking human-like intuition and creativity in problem-solving scenarios requiring #subjectivejudgment or #emotionalunderstanding. Therefore, it is essential to adopt first-principal thinking and prioritize data quality and quantity for accurate outcomes.

In nutshell, the relationship between artificial intelligence and humans is complex and multifaceted. With careful planning, ethical considerations, and collaboration, we can harness AI's power to benefit society while upholding human values. The future is bright, but only materializes when we work together.

In the recent past, I attended the ‚ÄúDeloitte Day ‚Äì HR Next‚Äù Conference in Switzerland, which aimed to explore the future of HR, specifically the Renaissance of People and Purpose in the context of Artificial Intelligence. Wherein they reinforced on OpenAI, Google AI, Meta Cultivating connections, and supercharging digital transformation in HR topics.

5501,5502,"Let's build robust AI applications using a multi-agent architecture. 

Multi-agent architecture refers to a system where multiple autonomous agents collaborate to solve complex problems. Each agent is specialized, allowing for efficient task execution and adaptability in dynamic environments. 

This architecture addresses challenges such as scalability, flexibility, and efficiency by distributing tasks among agents that can operate independently while communicating and coordinating with one another.

Implementing a multi-agent system can be illustrated through a customer support scenario. Imagine a setup where different agents handle specific inquiries: one agent specializes in technical issues, another in billing, and a third in product recommendations. 

When a customer reaches out, the system intelligently routes the inquiry to the appropriate agent based on the nature of the request. This specialization not only speeds up response times but also enhances the quality of service provided.

The future of multi-agent systems is promising as they offer significant advantages over traditional single-agent solutions. 

There are many platforms and tools such as LlamaIndex, CrewAI, LangChain, SingleStore, Dynamiq, AutoGen, MetaGPT, Haystack, OpenAI, etc that help you build multi-agent applications/systems.

5593,5594,"ChatGPT turned 2 last week... 

And it has absolutely changed my life.


In November 2022, OpenAI irreversibly changed the AI landscape.

I remember my friend first showing it to me when it blew up in the news.

I didn't exactly know how to react.

Today, I‚Äôve gone from trying to get it to create the perfect all time Premier League starting XI (still do this), to helping small businesses adopt it to win more clients.


The truth is: ChatGPT isn‚Äôt just a tool for PL starting 11's and creating images of cats giving quarterly growth reports to the board (as shown below).

For entrepreneurs - especially those of us in SMEs - it‚Äôs become indispensable.


Here‚Äôs how we're using it every day to drive bottom line growth for small businesses:

‚û° Content generation: we're setting up automated systems that understand individual personalities, brand voices and industry analysis to write content that converts for busy business owners.

‚û° Accelerating outbound success: be it cold emails or LinkedIn messaging, we're using AI to get personal, improve campaign success and write messages that get noticed.

‚û° Automated sales: from simple things like sending personalised confirmation messages from form fill outs to creating bespoke proposals from meeting transcriptions - we're helping sales teams save time and close more.



And yes, AI is best used alongside human creativity, but the right combination of both is the catalyst for growth every small business needs.



If this is what GPT is capable after just 2 years - what will it look like when it turns 5?

It's hard to say, but what I can say is: if you're a biz owner and still sitting on AI for your business, you are sitting on a huge opportunity.

5604,5605,"The fusion between #AI and #blockchain technologies is here.
Coinbase introduced its on AI toolkit that allows users to create #AI agents to conduct and monitor transactions on the #Base blockchain.  #AIagents

Coinbase claims that a user can create AI Agents for crypto assets using their existing templates and it would take around 3 mins for a user to create the AI Agent.

Once created, the agent can handle various #onchain tasks, from trades to swaps and staking.

‚ÄúOur goal here is to make it as easy as possible to start building your own AI agent,‚Äù Coinbase developer Lincoln Murr said in a video posted to X on Oct. 26. 

Murr said #Based Agent is a template that lets users build AI agents ‚Äî a ‚Äúbot‚Äù designed to carry out a specific task ‚Äî with access to various smart contract functions. 

Murr said for users to get started, they need an application programming interface (API) key from Coinbase‚Äôs developer program and ‚Äúa key from OpenAI, and to fork the Replit template.‚Äù

>What problems does crypto AI Agents solve?
You can program the agent to spot opportunities on different coins on the base blockchain and execute commands such as buy/sell.¬†You can set a range on different crypto coins for the AI Agent to follow and make trades based on price ranges that you define. 

>Why now?
Since crypto trading is a 24-hour market, you can schedule the AI agent to run 24 hours and to notice opportunities at any time of the day and make a trade accordingly.

>Other benefits?
You can configure your Agent to watch for newly minted coins on the based blockchain and make a buy at a certain price to get an edge on the market and increase your chance of profits. 

>Next?
developers will jump on this and start testing it for their own trading practices or promote their own agents to potential customers.

5786,5787,"***OpenAI‚Äôs Bold Expansion Plan üåç**
üí° 1 billion users in one year.

That‚Äôs the ambitious target OpenAI has set for itself‚Äîand it‚Äôs not just about numbers; it‚Äôs about reshaping the global AI landscape.

With 250 million weekly users already leveraging tools like ChatGPT, OpenAI is pushing boundaries by:
‚úÖ Building dedicated data centers to enhance efficiency.
‚úÖ Developing AI agents designed to perform complex tasks autonomously.
‚úÖ Introducing an AI-powered search engine that could redefine how we access information.

But scaling this rapidly isn‚Äôt just a technical challenge‚Äîit‚Äôs a mission to make cutting-edge AI accessible to billions, empowering businesses, educators, and creators alike.

As someone who‚Äôs worked in marketing, I can‚Äôt help but think about the ripple effects:
- How will this level of accessibility change consumer expectations?
- What new industries will emerge as AI becomes woven into our daily lives?
- And how should organizations prepare to stay competitive in this evolving landscape?

What‚Äôs clear: OpenAI‚Äôs roadmap is not just about tech‚Äîit‚Äôs about rewriting what‚Äôs possible.

‚ú® What‚Äôs your take?
Are we ready for an AI-driven world where everyone has access to such transformative tools? Share your thoughts below!

Employee Scheduling Automation. Here's how it works: 

Data Collection: Starts with Google Sheets to gather employee availability, preferences, and performance data if necessary.

API Integration: An HTTP module fetches additional data from your HR system.

AI-Powered Scheduling: OpenAI's GPT-4 generates a balanced schedule based on the collected data.

Distribution: The finalized schedule is updated in Google Sheets, emailed to employees, sent via SMS through Twilio, and stored in Google Drive.

Feedback Loop: Google Forms collects employee feedback for continuous improvement or change requests.

5884,5885,"""Finding clarity and connection through slowing down""

Once upon a time, motion was the measure of progress. People dreamed of faster horses, swift chariots, and, later, the blinding speed of rockets that could touch the stars. At great speeds, horizons collapsed, distances became trivial, and the world unfolded as a map rather than a rich, textured reality. Cities turned into dots, mountains into shapes, and rivers into mere streaks of blue.

But what happens when we slow down? Imagine leaving your car behind to walk the same path you speed through daily. The world that once blurred into oblivion reveals its details. The houses have character, stories etched into their facades; the gardens whisper of care and life. Hidden paths beckon, each one a mystery. The hum of traffic fades, and in its place, the symphony of birdsong and rustling leaves emerges. The air carries scents you'd never noticed, and the very ground beneath your feet feels alive, pulsating with a rhythm you now match step for step.

Slowing down doesn‚Äôt merely connect you with the external. The inner world awakens too. As the noise of the outside world softens, the whispers within grow louder. Thoughts untangle, emotions clarify, and something profound begins to stir: the faint yet unmistakable hum of the quantum field. It‚Äôs as if the universe itself is speaking, a quiet guidance illuminating your path. Intuition sharpens, and you begin to dance‚Äînot with your feet, but with the vibration of existence itself. It‚Äôs here that the ecstatic whirls of the Sufis make sense, as if they were attuning themselves to the Schumann resonance of 7.53 Hz, the Earth‚Äôs rhythmic heartbeat, or the resonant hum of ocean waves..

The everyday journey of life becomes a living meditation. Each step, breath, and heartbeat synchronizes with the pulse of the cosmos. Reality transforms into a tunnel‚Äîa series of layers that peel away, revealing deeper truths. The light at the tunnel's end calls not with urgency but with promise. It grows, not like a distant star but like a sun that fills your entire being. You realize this light is not outside of you but within, waiting for recognition.

And then, in no time you cross into the absolute. In that moment, speed, time, and motion dissolve. There is only stillness, yet it‚Äôs the most vibrant stillness imaginable. You are no longer a traveler but the journey itself, no longer seeking but being. The light engulfs you, infinite and eternal, and you know you have come home...

It‚Äôs not about perfection; it‚Äôs about motion‚Äîthose small, scrappy steps that build into something unstoppable.

For founders, momentum is the pulse of progress. Every email sent, every pitch delivered, every imperfect product update or post is a tiny link in the chain that pulls you and your startup closer to success.

Waiting for the perfect moment? Spoiler: it doesn‚Äôt exist. Momentum thrives on action‚Äîon trying, testing, and sometimes failing with flair.

Here‚Äôs the beauty: failure teaches, action builds, and progress compounds.

Imperfect action beats inaction any day.

Happy Monday. Dominate the week! üôåüèæ üí™üèæ

üöÄ  Excited to share a milestone in my project to make math learning more accessible and engaging for K12 students! üöÄ 
I‚Äôve developed a web-based interface that allows users to ask math questions and receive detailed step-by-step solutions. What‚Äôs even more exciting? I‚Äôve built two versions of the app:
1Ô∏è‚É£ OpenAI-powered modal: A robust, pre-trained solution delivering accurate math problem-solving capabilities.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Custom-trained modal: Built on top of OpenAI, this version is fine-tuned with a dataset tailored for K12 math, making it even more aligned with students' needs.
Here‚Äôs how it works:
üåê A simple web interface where students can input their math queries.
üß† The AI processes the input and delivers clear, step-by-step explanations.
‚ö° Fast and easy-to-use, designed with accessibility and scalability in mind.

6408,6409,"This post is for those who can't grasp as to why Jensen Huang is so passionate about ""Accelerating"" the ""#Telecom"" Industry!

ü§î What's in it for him in the long-term?

‚ñ™Ô∏èGreat New Growth

""A new era of accelerated computing has begun,"" says Huang in his keynotes. ""Every layer of the computing stack has been reinvented. From Coding-Software with 'rules & logic' to Machine-Learning of 'patterns & relationships'. From Code that runs on CPUs to Neural-Network processed by GPUs."" 

Fusing Radio-Computing and AI-Computing into one architecture seems to be a topic very dear to Huang's heart.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve fused radio signal processing and AI. This is going to be a #great #new #growth #opportunity for the telecommunications industry,"" he says as he passionately points towards Telco's Sovereign AI-Factories & *AI-RAN*.

‚ñ™Ô∏èReason for Passion

As per Huang, the next big thing to come is Agentic-AI, models that are capable of making decisions with little human intervention. See Level-3 AI in figure.

‚ÄúIf you can get AI to learn in an unsupervised way, then the human-labeling obstacle-bottleneck is eliminated,"" says Huang, and this is key ""path to amazing new things"" possibly alluding to the arrival of AGI.

The premise here is that Inference Compute availability needs to #explode, and no longer just grow linearly, with ""logically"" bigger #AI models, which have now already entered into ""thinking"" mode, like o1 from OpenAI.

#Inference #Compute requirements can't be simply fulfilled by relying on ""Centralized Inferencing Architecture"" complemented by ""On-Device"" computing. 

To realize this vision of AI-for-Everyone, for a better future, Huang envisions Distributed Edge Inferencing (EI) Architecture.

AI Needs EI - Edge AI Inference!

AI-RAN being the closest to the end-users is crucial in the 2030-2040 timeframe to realize AGI.

‚ñ™Ô∏è The AI-RAN Bandwagon

The AI-RAN in it's entirety (AI-for-RAN, AI-on-RAN and most crucially AI-and-RAN) is a key path to make AI an integral part of network infrastructure, enabling Telcos to unlock new #revenue streams and deliver enhanced experiences through generative AI, robotics and autonomous technologies. This should excite Telcos.

As for Nvidia, it's interest in AI-RAN goes beyond the tiny #vRAN market. It's all about AI/AGI vision realisation.

It is tied to Jensen's long term view in which he sees ""Telco Edge AI Inferencing"" or EI as one key pillar to realise the real AGI.

Therefore, if Nvidia's accelerated computing stack and Software 2.0 libraries are to be the foundation of Age-of-AI and AGI in next 10 years, then Huang certainly needs AI-RAN to be a primary choice of RAN Architecture in #6G era.

‚ñ™Ô∏èPath Ahead

Fujitsu has demonstrated it's intention with SoftBank""s #AITRAS.

Ericsson and Nokia are more than capable of leveraging Nvidia's AI Aerial Platform and embed their ""secret sauce"" to easily differentiate as an AI-RAN vendor.

ü§î But the age old question in Telecoms is - how willingly can anyone embrace disruption?",1,,

6523,6524,"Is ChatGPT at risk of shutting down?

Elon Musk still remembers his disagreement from nine years ago when he left OpenAI.

After nine years, he is the ""Doge minister"" and is suing again to stop OpenAI from changing from a non-profit to a profit-making company.

Do you remember? OpenAI's agreement states that its investors cannot invest in direct competitors, making it hard for many AI companies to access large funds like those from Microsoft, Nvidia, and Softbank.

If Musk wins the lawsuit, OpenAI may have to abandon its profit-making model and even repay its most recent investors. Without funding, ChatGPT could face closure due to high costs.

The situation is complicated because Musk has more power now.

As I mentioned before, we should not rely too much on foreign tools; we need to develop our own AI applications. Vietnam already has several good products (Such as LovinBot AI White label platform) that can serve as alternatives.

6587,6588,"Recently, I attended amazing events like Qatar Science & Technology Park  AI WEEK'24, ESI Conference‚Äô24, and sessions at Qatar University, along with my fellow peers Madhavi Dewalkar, Siddhi Ajay Naik and Purva Honrao. I learned a lot about how AI is transforming industries like healthcare, robotics, education, and workforce development. It‚Äôs exciting to see so many companies using AI to make their products better and more helpful.üöÄ

One startup really stood out to me. They created a VR simulation powered by models like OpenAI and Llama, where users could talk to an AI avatar to practice soft skills. In the simulation, the avatar was assigned a cleaning duty but wasn‚Äôt doing it properly, causing trouble for the entire team. My challenge was to convince him to take responsibility and complete the task. It felt so real‚Äîit was like interacting with an actual person! Even though I didn‚Äôt succeed in persuading the avatar (my approach was a bit too harsh üòÖ), it was a fun experience. This shows how AI can revolutionize career and personal development through immersive tools that make skill-building and professional training more effective and engaging.

But it got me thinking: what if the data used to train these AI systems is biased? AI learns from data, and if that data has flaws, it can lead to unfair outcomes. For example, many companies use AI to screen resumes, but if the AI is trained on biased data‚Äîlike past hiring decisions that favored certain groups‚Äîit might unfairly reject qualified candidates. This means talented people could be overlooked simply because of biases in the system, showing how the AI tools we rely on can shape decisions in ways we may not always notice.

I believe that while reducing bias in AI is possible, fully removing it is unlikely because humans themselves are inherently biased. Bias can never be completely eliminated, but we can work to identify and address it through more research and careful oversight. It‚Äôs crucial to have humans involved to evaluate and guide AI, ensuring its decisions are fair and reliable. AI can assist us, but it will never replace human creativity, intuition, or emotions.

These experiences reminded me that while AI can be incredibly helpful, we need to use it responsibly.

A heartfelt thank you to Neha Girme-Supekar for always assisting and guiding us at every step, and to Darkocean for providing this incredible opportunity to explore and learn.",1,,

As soon as the name comes up in the prompt, also ""the model crashes"". Current status of 12/01/2024 | 07:02 am. Tested in chatgpt 4o. Very interesting, try it out.

Pretty sure that this goes viral soon. 

Let¬¥s see how fast OpenAI will fix it.

Did you hear about the recent clash between some of Canada's major news outlets and OpenAI?

In a bold move, groups like the Toronto Star and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation are accusing OpenAI of using their website content without permission to train its ChatGPT models. This lawsuit seeks not just monetary damages but also aims to halt further use of their content. The news giants claim their intellectual property was used for commercial profit, without any consent or compensation.

OpenAI, on the flip side, argues that their practice falls under fair use, utilizing publicly available data, and offers publishers the option to opt-out. This lawsuit adds to a growing list, as other major entities like The New York Times and various YouTube creators, also take legal steps against OpenAI.

In our digital age, this raises essential questions about intellectual property, innovation, and the ethics of AI development. As professionals, how do we balance technological progress with protecting creative rights?

What are your thoughts on this legal battle? Can AI and journalism coexist without stepping on toes? Let's dive into the discussion below! üí¨

I mean, the actual weapon.

When we use that phrase, we often picture a balanced, ùò∫ùò™ùòØ-ùò∫ùò¢ùòØùò® scenario.

But I believe a double-edged sword is inherently more dangerous for the ùò∞ùò±ùò±ùò¥.

And I think ùóöùóºùóºùó¥ùóπùó≤  is a master at wielding this weapon, particularly with its products.

In the race to lead AI integration and adoption, alongside ùó¢ùóΩùó≤ùóªùóîùóú, 

Google has already unsheathed the double-edged sword.

While OpenAI is testing its ùòÄùó≤ùóÆùóøùó∞ùóµ ùó¥ùó≤ùóªùó≤ùóøùóÆùòÅùó∂ùòÉùó≤ ùóîùóú with a select group, 

Google has already integrated AI features directly into its Search engine, albeit experimentally.

I wrote a post about this a while ago. I'll link it in the comments.

The good news for SEO experts and digital marketers is that AI hasn't taken our jobs... yet!

Ranking on search generative AI still heavily relies on factors like:

‚Ä¢ùóñùóºùóªùòÅùó≤ùóªùòÅ relevance, depth, originality, clarity, and freshness

‚Ä¢ùóïùóÆùó∞ùó∏ùóπùó∂ùóªùó∏ quantity, quality, and relevance

Samsung Electronics has introduced Gauss 2, its second-generation multimodal AI model, designed to revolutionize AI integration across devices like smartphones, tablets, laptops, and home appliances. This cutting-edge model is capable of processing diverse data types‚Äîsuch as text, images, and code‚Äîsimultaneously. With three configurations‚ÄîCompact, Balanced, and Supreme‚ÄîGauss 2 is tailored to suit various user needs, from lightweight on-device tasks to more robust AI applications.

The Compact version enables offline functionality, providing seamless operations without relying on internet connectivity. Gauss 2 enhances key features such as Browsing Assist, Call Assist, Chat Assist, Generative AI Edit, Interpreter, Note Assist, and Sketch-to-Image tools, delivering faster, more efficient, and higher-quality performance. This innovation emphasizes privacy, reduced latency, and improved UX.

I compared Gauss 2 with other models üëá

How Gauss 2 Stands Against Other Leading AI Models

1. OpenAI's GPT-4

Renowned for its sophisticated text and image understanding, GPT-4 supports diverse applications, from creative writing to complex problem-solving.

However, its proprietary nature limits accessibility, making it less customizable for developers compared to open models.

2. Meta's LLaMA 2:

Designed as an open-source solution, LLaMA 2 provides flexibility and transparency, enabling developers to tailor it to specific needs.

While effective in language processing tasks, its capabilities are more domain-specific and may not match the breadth of larger models like GPT-4.

3. Google's PaLM 2:

Specializes in coding, multilingual capabilities, and domain-specific tasks. PaLM 2 integrates seamlessly with Google‚Äôs ecosystem, enhancing its usability across various platforms.

It shines in niche areas but lacks the multimodal focus of models like Gauss 2.

Why Gauss 2 Matters

Gauss 2 is Samsung‚Äôs bold step toward integrating advanced AI across its ecosystem. By focusing on on-device AI processing, Samsung addresses key concerns around privacy and performance. The model's flexible configurations ensure it caters to diverse needs, from lightweight local tasks to more intensive AI-powered functionalities. This approach not only enhances user experiences but also positions Samsung as a strong competitor in the AI space.

With Gauss 2, Samsung demonstrates its commitment to leveraging AI to create smarter, more personalized, and efficient devices. Its seamless integration across its product portfolio gives it a unique edge.

My Thoughts: 
Gauss 2 reflects Samsung‚Äôs ambition to push the boundaries of device-centric AI, offering innovative solutions that prioritize privacy, speed, and versatility. As it joins the ranks of industry-leading AI models, Gauss 2 sets a new benchmark for multimodal AI in the consumer technology space.

Artists testing OpenAI's new AI video tool, Sora, leaked it to protest unpaid labor and ""art washing"" ‚Äî using artists to boost AI's credibility without fair compensation. üö®

The leaked tool allowed users to generate numerous AI videos in 1080p 10 seconds, resembling the company's demos before OpenAI shut down access. OpenAI responded by asserting that participation in the research preview was voluntary and that it had been supporting artists through grants and other programs.

While OpenAI calls it voluntary, critics ask: Is this ethical?

The new financing will allow the Japanese tech conglomerate to get an even larger slice of the AI startup and allow current and former OpenAI employees to cash out their shares, two people familiar with the matter told CNBC.
Employees will have until Dec. 24 to decide if they want to participate in the new tender offer, which has not previously been reported, one of the people said. The deal was spurred by SoftBank billionaire founder and CEO Masayoshi Son, who was persistent in asking for a larger stake in the startup after putting $500 million into OpenAI‚Äôs last funding round, one of the people said.
The tender offer is not related to OpenAI‚Äôs potential plans to restructure the firm¬†to a for-profit business, one of the people said."" Source: <URL>",0,,

Shared on OpenAI's own social media channels, ""Pile"" is part of a showcase with Bengt Tibert.

Tibert, ""an AI artist with a background as a Creative Director in advertising, focusing primarily on video"" says:

üëâ ""What struck me most was the realistic physics. The objects seem tangible, like they exist in a physical space and have their own mass.""

I beg to differ. Just try to keep track of any individual character or hat to see it disappear, fuse with another or be compressed into impossible shapes.

The physics in this clip are anything BUT realistic.

Bodies melting, arms and legs flailing, faces missing - don't get me started on the hands.

Several months have passed since Sora AI was first teased. There is a lot more competition in AI video solutions today.

Based on the recent clips that are surfacing, OpenAI hasn't been able to address the issues that were discussed back then.

Thoughts?

While domain registration and trademark ownership are important factors, the real challenge lies in proving the conceptual origin and implementation of ""open AI"" as a business model. Having worked extensively in enterprise architecture, I understand how critical IP protection is, but also how common parallel innovation can be in tech.

The judge's dismissal of most counterclaims suggests the strength of OpenAI's position, yet the ongoing dispute reflects broader challenges in AI governance and ownership. This case will likely influence how tech companies approach naming and branding in the future.

Sounds unrealistic? Right? 

But Amazon just made it a reality!

And it's not about search, it's about redefining how we interact with videos.

Amazon is steeping out its AI game with a new model called Olympus. 

This is designed to process videos and images alongside text!

Traditionally, Amazon relied on Anthropic AI for its AWS services. 

But with Olympus, Amazon is making its path in generative AI. 

This LLM (large language model) can analyze video scenes with precision. 

e.g. it can identify a basketball's trajectory or detect underwater drilling issues. 

This is Amazon‚Äôs answer to competitors like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI. 

Amazon might introduce Olympus next week at AWS re: Invent.

This is more than just a product launch, it is a smart move from Amazon

And it will completely change how you interact with AI

OpenAI quietly released this insane new feature in beta.

Here's what it can do:
‚Ü≥ Write code directly in VSCode
‚Ü≥ Make commits through Terminal
‚Ü≥ Debug in Xcode
‚Ü≥ Access your development environment

But there's something bigger happening here.
This isn't just about coding assistance.
It's OpenAI's first step towards building Agentic AI systems.

Think about it:
Chat interface (2022)
‚Ü≥ Basic text conversations

App integration (Now)
‚Ü≥ Direct interaction with your tools

Agentic Desktop control (Coming soon)
‚Ü≥ Full system automation

The ""Operator"" agent is next. 
Bloomberg reports it's launching in January.

This means AI won't just suggest stuff...
It will be able to think and take actions like a human.

But here's what everyone's missing:
The real value isn't in the automation.
It's in the learning.

Watching AI interact with your tools,
You'll discover workflows you never knew existed.

7216,7217,"OpenAI Sora was leaked!!

Artists with early access to Sora leaked it, saying they were being used for unpaid work by a $150B company. They claim the program is more about PR than real collaboration, as OpenAI must approve all outputs. The leak is meant to let others experiment and push for better support for artists.

But after 3 hours,¬†OpenAI¬†blocks all access for artists.

Upon reviewing the output on X, it doesn't seem particularly impressive. While it was impressive in February, many companies such as¬†Runway,¬†Luma AI,¬†krea.ai,¬†and¬†Pika¬†have since achieved similar or even superior quality and prompt understanding.

What do you think about this situation?

Today, we reached build number 500 of Meal plans & recipes: OH, a potato! on Testflight. Just the 2 of us with limited time and money. 

500 different iterations, 500 quick fixes and big changes, conflicts and resolutions.

It's been wild! It is wild.

The product looks completely different from where it was 2 years ago, 1 year ago, and 6 months ago. We've grown from a hobby into a running business that has paying users and generates over 800‚Ç¨ euro a month. It might not seem like a lot to some, but if you try doing something on your own, you'll quickly learn how difficult it is to monetize without pouring in marketing money.

Since this number made me reflect, here are my favorite moments from this year:

1. We thought we were launching on Product Hunt in the afternoon, but we miscalculated the time zone difference and ended up launching in the morning. My phone was going crazy, and it was hard to grasp what was happening. The first few hours were insane, but we secured Product of the Day, Product of the Week, and AI Product of the Week. We never thought OH, a potato! would do so well so we unfortunately weren't strategic about our launch timing and missed our chance to win product of the month (we launched at the end of the month ü´†). 

2. We introduced a bug in one of the updates, and users started writing to support, claiming we had locked them out of the app. Radu obviously panicked, but I was thrilled that people cared about our product and used it regularly. ü•∞

3. We offered lifetime access for free for a limited time to drive more ratings and reviews, but right before the launch, we introduced a bug that broke the core UX. It wasn't a quick fix, and it took us a few days to recover from it emotionally. But guess what? Now, we have a strict protocol for regression testing. ü§òüèª

4. We drove over 20,000 downloads organically just by making the app free for a limited time. We also learned that free users can be the toughest. If something doesn't work as expected, they go straight to the App Store review section, whereas paid users tend to send a kind email to support... ü´∂üèª

5. One day, someone wrote that the cookbook scanning feature wasn't working anymore. After some time, we realized he had scanned 100 (!) recipes in 2 days. At one point, while experimenting with OpenAI, we implemented a safety measure limiting scans to 100, thinking no one would exceed that. He definitely had his Potato-AHA moment. üí°

We now have a roadmap; I create bug tickets, we hold weekly prioritization sessions, and most importantly, Radu Lupu has accepted that I'm better at design and I have the final say there. üòè

Cheers to many more fun moments, together, Radu Lupu! ‚ú®",1,,

Today‚Äôs news about Canadian media organizations filing a lawsuit against OpenAI highlights a pivotal moment for the future of generative AI. As I discussed in my recent CHCH interview, the issue at the heart of these legal battles is how AI companies use copyrighted content to train their models‚Äîand whether this use is ethical, legal, and sustainable.

This lawsuit could signal the need for a shift in how the AI industry operates. One possibility is the emergence of a licensing model, where AI developers would pay for access to high-quality, copyrighted content to train their systems. Such a model could:
- Ensure fair compensation for content creators.
- Encourage responsible and ethical AI development.
- Foster collaboration between AI companies and industries like journalism, rather than conflict.

AI has immense potential to transform industries, but it must be built on a foundation of trust and mutual respect. If we can find ways to fairly compensate creators while still enabling innovation, we may set the stage for a more equitable and sustainable AI-driven future.

7583,7584,"The AI vs Copyright issue continues üëâüèΩ Canadian news publishers sue OpenAI over alleged copyright infringement

According to AP News a coalition of Canadian news publishers has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI for using news content to train its ChatGPT generative artificial intelligence system.

The outlets said in a joint statement on Friday that OpenAI regularly breaches copyright by scraping large amounts of content from Canadian media.

‚ÄúOpenAI is capitalizing and profiting from the use of this content, without getting permission or compensating content owners,‚Äù the statement said.

The publishers argue that OpenAI practices undermine the hundreds of millions of dollars invested in journalism, and that content is protected by copyright.

I think it‚Äôs important to highlight that this is not just an OpenAI issue or GPT issue exclusively. 

Most, if not all, commercial LLMs are trained on scraped content from all over the web, which cause a whole load of other issues with biases and garbage content etc.

This issue has been a problem for publishers well before LLMs. Search engines, for example, were getting it in the neck for similar practices of displaying news headlines and summaries etc.

There needs to be clearer regulations and some sort of regulatory realignment to clarify how AI models and content creators should coexist.

The current ludicrous arguments of either banning AI companies from using copyrighted content outright, or deregulate and allow AI companies to just steal creators‚Äô work and totally dismiss creators‚Äô right of ownership are the real barriers to innovation.

It‚Äôs just lazy politics and lazy AI with damaging outcomes.

Unfortunately, it won‚Äôt get any better with the current global political picture and I feel (perhaps selfishly) that the UK is in a very unique position to lead in this area and bring back our pre-Brexit tech glory. We need to do something beyond talking and debating.

I discussed this issue with UK‚Äôs leading tech and media lawyer Raoul Lumb from Simons Muirhead Burton LLP couple of months ago (link in the comments). I welcome your thoughts below.

7617,7618,"Eliza AI: When Advanced AI Meets Crypto

Eliza is a groundbreaking AI agent framework created by the ai16z team. It's designed to be a completely autonomous system that can interact across multiple platforms. 

The technology allows AI agents to engage in natural conversations, analyze market data, and execute trading strategies without human intervention.

The technical foundation of Eliza is impressive. At its core, it can connect to various AI models including Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT series, and local models through Ollama. 

This flexibility lets developers choose the best AI model for their needs. The system also includes advanced memory systems for maintaining conversation context, and can process market sentiment in real-time.

On the infrastructure side, we are running Eliza on a distributed AWS architecture. Developers can also run it locally using Docker containers, making it accessible for testing and development.

The project gained widespread attention in November 2024 due to an unexpected token launch situation. Two ELIZA tokens appeared in the market, creating confusion in the trading community. 

The original team at ai16z, led by developer Shaw, had to address this by endorsing a new official token. They also offered to protect early investors with a 10% allocation of the new token.

Despite the token drama, Eliza represents a significant advance in AI agent technology. Its ability to connect with different language models, process real-time data, and maintain consistent personality traits across platforms makes it a powerful tool for autonomous AI applications in the crypto space.

7624,7625,"SORA LEAKING + OPENAI‚ÄôS TROUBLING RESPONSE: A PATTERN OF NEGLECTING ARTISTS.

The recent '#Sora access #leak' incident highlights a recurring issue: OpenAI‚Äôs inability to properly recognize and support the #artists who contributed to its successes.

Let‚Äôs rewind to 2022. Under the leadership of Natalie Summers, OpenAI before launching Dall‚Ä¢E, launched a promising artist program. Natalie understood the potential of a thriving artist community. She led initiatives that allowed artists to collaborate with OpenAI developers, giving feedback that directly shaped the tools we see today. I brought renowned Dutch artists such as ‚ú∞ Arno Coenen, ‚òÖ Olivier Teepe, Bas Kosters, Martin Koolhoven, Suzy One Kenobi and Tinkebell to her group. Yet OpenAI made no effort to learn who these artists were. A missed opportunity.

The Sora program mirrored this shortcoming. Only 7 of all the artists were briefly featured in a blog post in March 2024. Artists value recognition. A simple spotlight on their work. It‚Äôs not always about money. Imagine if OpenAI had created a platform to showcase artist portraits, their Dall‚Ä¢E and Sora art, interviews about their creative processes. This approach would've built goodwill within the creative community. Instead, artists felt like ‚Äúdebuggers‚Äù.

Instead, OpenAI started hiring sales- and young, cheap PR reps who seemed disconnected from OpenAI‚Äôs history and dismissive of the people who helped build the brand: At their 2023 Cannes Lions rooftop event, I experienced this firsthand. Despite my pioneering DALL‚Ä¢E experiments‚Äîincluding ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs Be Friends,‚Äô the world's first AI-generated, animated short film, it won an important award at Oberhausen‚Äôs 69th International Short Film Festival‚Äîthese PR-kids showed little interest in OpenAI‚Äôs foundational contributors. Instead, I was treated being a nuisance.

Once Natalie Summers tried to build bridges with artist, but it seems OpenAI didn‚Äôt support her vision. Or perhaps even Natalie underestimated the importance of recognizing artists. Hereby - again - I'm offering you my help. Either way, the result is clear: a missed opportunity to turn contributors into ambassadors.

The Sora leak underscores this neglect. Walter Woodman, co-creator of 'Shy Kids' their 'Air Head', told me in an interview I had with him at The AI Film Fest Amsterdam, how OpenAI‚Äôs utilitarian approach treats creators as liabilities rather than partners.

What OpenAI Must Do:

1: Create a dedicated Artist Platform with profiles, interviews, galleries. 2: Maintain open communication channels like we had during the early DALL‚Ä¢E days. 3: Recognize artists as partners who bring unique perspectives, not just as beta testers.

Supporting artists isn‚Äôt just good ethics‚Äîit‚Äôs good business. Companies like Midjourney (their magazine is a smart example) have built 'love brands' by growing strong relationships with their communities. OpenAI must do the same. ASAP.

Let‚Äôs hope OpenAI learns from its mistakes and charts a new path forward.",2,,

The problem is that the world moves fast. If not a bit too fast, sometimes. It only takes one unicorn startup to upend the market and dictate customer behavior; many big companies one CEO reshuffling away to becoming the next Apple.

But this reality is not a blanket permission to bet your entire business on the next shiny idea. Fearlessly taking risks is simply a romanticized version of 'not knowing what the hell you're doing'. It may be fun to daydream being the next OpenAI, but these companies are edge cases.

For many of us, it's all about taking calculated risks.¬†
¬†
It's about gradually moving the needle by constantly making small decisions where the rewards far outweigh the risks. Sure, you may fail in some of them, but when the alternative is certain death by competition, the smart thing to do is think outside the box, exhaust your best options, and roll the dice¬†‚Äî praying you get the chance to roll again tomorrow.

7726,7727,"Calling AI applications ‚Äúwrappers‚Äù misses the mark. 

When companies like Facebook, Shopify, and Salesforce launched, no one dismissed them as mere ‚ÄúSQL wrappers.‚Äù SQL and relational databases operated behind the scenes without releasing consumer-facing products. Developers built upon these tools to create solutions without the foundational technology overshadowing their work.

Today, companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have brought foundational technology to the forefront by releasing products like ChatGPT and Claude directly to consumers. In my opinion, this visibility has skewed public perception, leading some to label new applications built on these models as just ‚Äúwrappers.‚Äù

From my experience developing AI identity verification solutions at Veratad, I can say that building effective LLM-powered applications requires proprietary development that goes far beyond simple API integration. It requires:

- Prompt engineering
- Fine-tuning
- RAG
- Chaining
- Agent development and tooling
- Agent workflow building
- Observing, Experimenting, Evaluating, Iterating, Annotating
- UI/UX design
- Etc

All this work is proprietary and essential to delivering real value to customers. 

So, should we really dismiss these AI applications as mere ‚Äúwrappers,‚Äù or should we acknowledge the significant innovation and effort that goes into building solutions that truly meet users‚Äô needs?

This enables real-time web search for up-to-date info directly through prompts.

For now, they‚Äôre sourcing news only from partner publishers. 

A few thoughts:

‚û°Ô∏èActivating web search on their API is not yet available which is a big downside

‚û°Ô∏èA filter option for specific publishers? That would add some serious value.

‚û°Ô∏è Want more flexibility? You can still leverage function calling or custom tools for tailored searches.

‚ùìAre you still Googling? My search behavior completely changed!

While foundation model providers like OpenAI ($157B) and Anthropic ($40B) dominate headlines in the GenAI era, here‚Äôs a fact many overlook: AI teams still spend 80% of their time on data preparation and only 20% on model building (hasn't changed much in the last years).

So what does this mean? üëá

1Ô∏è‚É£ Massive growth potential in data infrastructure layer.
Companies tackling this issue are poised to grow. Databricks ($43B valuation) is already benefitting, but others like DataRobot and Alteryx are also redefining AutoML and MLOps.

2Ô∏è‚É£ The GenAI hype wave is evolving.
As the buzz around models settles, the focus will shift. The real game-changers? Those who optimize the entire AutoML/ MLOps process.

3Ô∏è‚É£ The next frontier in AI is about reducing the 80%‚Äîand the companies who do this best will drastically facilitate mass adoption of AI.

8130,8131,"""xAI's #Grok Chatbot Set to Compete with Established #AI Players"".

Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, #xAI, is gearing up to launch a standalone app for its Grok chatbot as early as December 2024. This strategic move positions Grok as a direct competitor to established AI chatbots such as OpenAI‚Äôs #ChatGPT, Google‚Äôs #Gemini, and Anthropic‚Äôs #Claude, all of which already have dedicated consumer applications.

Launch Timeline:
The app is expected to be released in December 2024.

Market Positioning:
#xAI aims to capture a significant share of the growing AI market, which has seen rapid advancements and fierce competition.
Grok will be available independently, moving beyond its current accessibility through #X (formerly Twitter), where it is limited to premium subscribers.

Technological Features:
#Grok is trained on public data sourced from X, allowing it to interact in a more natural language and access up-to-date information compared to competitors.
Musk's xAI has recently introduced an API for developers, indicating a broader strategy to enhance Grok's capabilities and accessibility.

Competitive Landscape:
The introduction of Grok is anticipated to reshape user preferences and drive innovation within the AI sector.
Musk's rivalry with #OpenAI is notable, having previously filed lawsuits against the company over ideological differences and contractual disputes.

Financial Outlook:
#xAI has reached a valuation of approximately 50 billion and is projected to surpass 100 million in annual revenue, although it still trails behind OpenAI's valuation of $157 billion.

The launch of #Grok as a standalone app signifies a pivotal moment in the AI landscape, potentially altering how users engage with AI technologies and expanding the competitive field.

8458,8459,"Coca-Cola must have saved at least $1,000,000 by creating this Ad through Gen AI. Here‚Äôs what unfolded üëá

Coca-Cola has become synonymous with Christmas ever since it began using images of Santa Claus enjoying a Coke in the 1930s.

However, it was the iconic ‚ÄúHolidays Are Coming!‚Äù ad from 1995 that truly captured the hearts, remaining a festive favourite for over two decades.

This memorable ad depicted a convoy of Christmas-lit trucks arriving in a snowy town, spreading joy and cheer.

Now, 29 years later, Coca-Cola has brought this beloved ad back. But this time, they didn‚Äôt spend $1 Mn+ to recreate it.

Instead, Coca-Cola used Gen AI to produce the ad. From the iconic snowy town to the Coca-Cola truck and even the characters in the ad, everything was created using AI.

This isn‚Äôt the first time Coca-Cola has used AI. Last year, they launched a limited-edition drink, Coca-Cola Y3000, which featured the label: ‚ÄúCo-Created with AI.‚Äù

It‚Äôs clear there‚Äôs a significant shift happening in the advertising world, with AI gradually finding its place in commercial applications.

However, Coca-Cola is facing backlash from audiences online.

Many feel this new AI-generated ad lacks the authenticity and warmth that define the Christmas spirit.

Coca-Cola isn‚Äôt the only legacy brand to receive criticism for using Gen AI in their campaigns. 

In June, Toys ‚ÄúR‚Äù Us faced similar backlash for a commercial created using Sora, a tool developed by OpenAI.

So, how will AI achieve mainstream acceptance in creative industries?

The road to assimilation won‚Äôt be easy, and audiences may continue to challenge its authenticity and emotional impact.",2,,

8614,8615,"You might have the most advanced and reliable AI autonomous agent, but you're AI agent might be worthless unless you have a competitive advantage now and in the future.

Technical advantages related to product innovation generally only last about 3-6 months where a healthy startup ecosystem could result in incumbents or startups to win-so how can you're AI autonomous agent stay competitive and be a breakout decacorn and have a competitive mote long into the future?

Well, here's how I think about it:

1. Improvement & Data Flywheel Network Effect:
This is the importance of a self-learning AI agent. Self-learning is now capable if you have access to OpenAI's 01-preview (reasoning engine) but imagine it's smart enough to take feedback in plain language and strategically update it's system-level prompts to improve itself? I'm describing a soon ultra-valuable paradigm shift to the development cycle where the AI autonomous agent can suggest and make improvements to itself for iterations cycles measured in hours and not weeks.

This system too takes a lot of engineering, testing, and deploying (human in the loop and guardrails) but you can image an unstoppable application-layer company that's able to iterate in this way. The absolutely exciting part is it's now entirely possible with the 01-preview and 01 by OpenAI's reasoning engine and those that we'll have access to in the future (as they continue to be more cost-effective etc.).

Data: Kingdom Stays .ai can show you right now a large, proprietary documentation center of industry-specific procedural sets that power our AI agent through agentic RAG, resulting in industry expert decisions as default settings. This internal documentation center is so large, it's equivalent to 1000 manuscript pages worth of information that accounts for nearly every situation.

2. Different types of 2-sided network effects between multiple user categories of the same AI application layer, where the more there are users on the platform in one category provides a higher value for those users in another category. We can imagine what are called ""managed marketplaces"" where we will see new marketplaces that simply wouldn't exist otherwise unless an a robust AI agent manages aspects of the 2-sided marketplace(s). Network effects like this and data network effects are very powerful and sticky for users to use and can be the differentiator between you and a competitor in the future.

We need a healthy startup ecosystem in AI agent engineering and building so please like and share this post. Is there anything I'm missing? How do you think about this?

8719,8720,"üö® Big News in the AI World: Elon Musk vs. OpenAI and Microsoft üö®
Elon Musk has taken legal action yet again, filing for an injunction against OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging anticompetitive practices and raising concerns about OpenAI's transformation from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity. The lawsuit also names key figures such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman among others.
The Allegations
Musk's filing accuses OpenAI and Microsoft of:
Discouraging investors from supporting competitors like his own xAI.
Misusing competitively sensitive information gained through partnerships.
Engaging in practices that breach OpenAI‚Äôs original charitable mission of building AI for the benefit of humanity.
He argues that these actions harm not just him but the broader AI ecosystem and the public.
The Bigger Picture
This legal battle highlights deeper tensions in the AI industry as the lines between innovation, competition, and ethics blur. OpenAI‚Äôs pivot to a for-profit model has sparked debates about the balance between advancing technology and staying true to founding principles.
While OpenAI calls Musk‚Äôs claims baseless, this lawsuit raises important questions:
Can a mission-driven organization stay true to its values while pursuing profitability?
How do we ensure fair competition in a rapidly growing industry with immense stakes?
What‚Äôs your take on this? Are we witnessing a critical moment for ethics in AI, or is this just another corporate power struggle? Let‚Äôs discuss. üëá

This is happening üöÄ

OpenAI‚Äôs upcoming project, codenamed Operator, aims to bridge the gap between passive AI tools and fully autonomous agents. Early 2025, Operator promises to execute tasks independently, like booking flights, coding, or organizing your digital life from your computer‚Äîall with minimal supervision. üß†

The rise of ""autonomous agents"" like Operator might redefine productivity tools. Instead of asking AI how to do something, you tell it what to do‚Äîand it just gets done. Competitors like Microsoft and Anthropic are racing into this space, but OpenAI‚Äôs Operator might be the game-changer‚Äã

Autonomy is exciting but also raises questions about trust and control. Can we ensure Operator makes the ‚Äúright‚Äù choices? Will users feel comfortable handing over control? These are the challenges OpenAI and the industry must tackle now.

But they want to take over search

It's funny because they're trying to do it 
right in front of Google on their home turf

A few days ago OpenAi released a new 
Chrome extension called ChatGPT Search


It makes ChatGPT your default search engine

You can find it here:
<URL>

It opens ChatGPT for your searches instead of Google
I still use Google to find local services but nothing else
Lots of people are saying how great searching w/ this is
And I must admit, it's a heck of a lot better than Google
I use Perplexity for web searches because I find it's better


Do you think Google will ban this Chrome extension?

9044,9045,"üöÄ Exciting Journey into AI Engineering!
Hello, LinkedIn family!
I‚Äôm thrilled to share my journey as an AI Engineer, a path that has been both challenging and incredibly rewarding. üåü

When I started in this field, mastering Python üêç was my first step. It‚Äôs amazing how this powerful language has opened doors to endless possibilities in AI.

One of the game-changers for me was discovering Streamlit üìä. This tool has simplified building applications, allowing me to focus more on solving problems rather than getting bogged down by the intricacies of app development. It‚Äôs user-friendly and perfect for quick rollouts of AI models into usable applications. üí°

Throughout my career, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work with various Large Language Models ü§ñ, including OpenAI‚Äôs GPT series. These models are not just tools; they are gateways to understanding and leveraging natural language processing in ways I never imagined before. üåê

Here‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîAI is not just a trend; it‚Äôs the future. üíº The potential to develop AI-driven tools that can accelerate processes and decision-making in any field is enormous. For example:
	‚Ä¢	Automating routine tasks ü§ù
	‚Ä¢	Analyzing large datasets quickly üìà
	‚Ä¢	Providing insights beyond human capability üîç

For anyone sitting on the fence about diving into AI, here‚Äôs my message:
‚û°Ô∏è The future is here, and it‚Äôs automated with Artificial Intelligence! ü§© The learning curve might seem steep, but the opportunities AI presents are worth every bit of effort. Tools like Python üñ•Ô∏è and Streamlit ‚öôÔ∏è simplify the complex and make the impossible possible.

Let‚Äôs embrace AI and continue to innovate and create solutions that not only enhance our professional lives but also contribute positively to society. üåç If I can do it, you can too! Let‚Äôs gear up to be part of this exciting future. üí™

üí° Now, over to you!
What‚Äôs your imaginary idea for an AI use case? Whether it‚Äôs something fun, futuristic, or transformative, drop it in the comments! Let‚Äôs brainstorm the next big thing together. üí¨

#ArtificialIntelligence #Python #Streamlit #OpenAI #Technology #Innovation #FutureOfWork
#CareerInAI #LearningAndDevelopment

Feel free to reach out if you‚Äôre curious about starting your journey in AI or need tips on navigating this field. Let‚Äôs learn and grow together! üôå

	‚Ä¢	Regulation is a hot topic

But on the flip side:

	‚Ä¢	The non-profit model didn‚Äôt work out
	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs not Sam saving us from centralized AI‚Äîit‚Äôs open-source models leading the way

Bold vision, but reality took a different path.

9153,9154,"üî• The AI talent wars just got even spicier! 

Here's today's most interesting thing in AI recruitment...

Mistral AI (Europe's AI golden child) is setting up shop in Palo Alto, with one founder potentially making the move from Paris. 

But here's what's REALLY fascinating...

This isn't just another ""tech company moves to Silicon Valley"" story. Our data shows that:

üëâüèª The San Francisco Bay Area has 9,574 dedicated Machine Learning professionals (up 8% from last year)
üëâüèª The average tenure of AI talent in Silicon Valley is just 1.1 years 
üëâüèª Female representation in AI roles is still only 27% in the Bay Area

The kicker? Despite Macron championing Mistral as Europe's answer to OpenAI, this move speaks volumes about where the world's top AI talent congregates.

Even with a ¬£2B valuation and backing from tech giants (Microsoft, Salesforce, Nvidia), Mistral knows one truth:

You've got to fish where the fish are! üé£

Think about it - when 59% of the world's top AI talent is concentrated in one region, can any serious player afford not to be there?

What do you think - is this a smart move by Mistral, or should Europe be doing more to retain its AI champions? 

Drop your thoughts below üëá

Thanks for everything and see you at work! ‚ù§Ô∏è
