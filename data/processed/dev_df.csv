2,3,"The average Google senior engineer makes ~$375,000 per year. The average OpenAI senior engineer makes ~$750,000 per year, double that of Google.

This is a huge reason why OpenAI is so far ahead despite having a fraction of the resources, with ChatGPT getting 15x more organic traffic than Google's Gemini.

Google is probably the most legendary tech company of all time, hiring the top 1% of engineers. OpenAI's strategy is to hire the top 1% of the top 1%.

When it comes to talent, the main ingredient isn't rocket science: If you pay more, you will get better people. This is how capitalism fundamentally works.

While Google hires rockstars, OpenAI hires rockstars among rockstars. This, combined with their leaner startup culture, allows them to get far more done.

12,13,"#Alibaba #QwQ Really Impresses at GPT-o1 Levels

#Two common debates in generative AI revolve around whether reasoning is the next frontier for foundation models and how competitive #Chinese models will be with those from the West. This week, a release from #Alibaba sheds light on both topics.

Since its initial release, #GPT-o1 has been regarded as the most sophisticated model for long-term reasoning tasks. 

The model validated several key ideas in generative AI, such as the shift from pretraining to inference. Since then, many models have aimed to match GPT-01’s performance in reasoning tasks. 

Somewhat surprisingly, the most interesting challengers have come from China. Last week, DEEPSEEK showcased its R1 model, which matched 
#GPT-01's performance across several reasoning benchmarks. This week, it was Alibaba’s turn.

Alibaba Group's latest addition to the #Qwen family, Qwen with Questions (QwQ), is making waves in the AI community as a strong open-source competitor to OpenAI's GPT-01 reasoning model. 

#QwQ, currently available in a #32-billion-parameter preview version with a 32,000-token context, has already demonstrated impressive capabilities in benchmark tests. In both the #AIME and #MATH benchmarks, which evaluate mathematical problem-solving abilities, QwQ outperforms GPT-o1-preview. 

This achievement highlights the model's strength in handling complex mathematical problems. Additionally, QwQ #surpasses GPT-01-mini on GPQA, a benchmark focused on scientific reasoning, further showcasing its proficiency in understanding and responding to scientific queries. While QwQ lags behind GPT-o1 in the LiveCodeBench coding benchmark, 
it still outperforms other frontier models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, solidifying its position as a strong contender in the large reasoning model (LRM) landscape.

Alibaba's philosophy behind QwQ emphasizes the importance of ""patient inquiry"" and ""thoughtful analysis"" in achieving true understanding. QwQ embodies this approach by engaging in a step-by-step reasoning process, akin to a student meticulously reviewing their work to identify and learn from mistakes. #Examples showcased on the Qwen website demonstrate QwQ's ability to ""think aloud,"" meticulously evaluating different possibilities and refining its approach as it tackles complex problems. 

#This transparency offers valuable insights into the model's reasoning mechanisms and underscores Alibaba's commitment to promoting a deeper understanding of #LRMs' functions.

17,18,"So after doing about 1.6k calls with one of our inbound systems, we wanted to analyse the conversations in some way, with goal to improve the current prompt or set up.

I tried putting in the transcripts excel sheet into ChatGPT in anonymous mode, but that doesn't go well with huge amounts of data as it makes quite a lot of mistakes. 

Then thought maybe I can make something in make . com but with ~1.6k rows, an iterator, openai module, then an update sheets module, thats at least ~4.8k ops just for all those conversations. 

Couple weeks back installed n8n on Render, and thought about giving that a go, and man its good! Ran all those rows with no cost per operation, only per whole scenario run. So I did it in batches of 100 or even 500 and it went sooo smooth 🔥

Anyway we learned that ~22% of the time the caller requests to speak to a specific team member, so we're going to do an upsell on that data. 

If you got any other ideas, or have some kind of other systems that can go through excel/sheets and analyse accurately, let me know pls! 💪

22,23,"Some great truth telling from Andrej Karpathy (former director of AI at Tesla and member of founding team at OpenAI). When we “ask an AI” about something or how to do something, we are effectively asking the data labeler who labeled this data and trained the AI to respond to this question with the labeled answer. This is not about “AI magic” but about good data labeling and training. The better we understand how AI and LLM’s work, the better we will be at setting our expectations and putting in place proper review and control workflows when using AI and LLM’s in legal work. They key to using AI in improving and accelerating legal work is to first understand what it is and how it works.

23,24,"And it’s finally here: OpenAI has launched its own AI search engine!

It combines Google’s search functionality with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Instead of giving you a list of links, it responds directly to your question in ChatGPT style, delivering one, concise answer. This isn’t just the top search result, but a synthesized answer based on all the information OpenAI has gathered.

The response includes links to relevant pages and a “source chip” showing all the sites ChatGPT consulted to generate the answer. You can even ask for images, flights, and more. The results are impressive so far.

To try it out, just click the globe icon in the ChatGPT text box.

In my opinion, this move is one of OpenAI’s strategic goals. They’ve been focused on attracting users over revenue to make ChatGPT users accustomed to the interface and responses. Transitioning AI users to a new search engine is easier than converting brand-new users. OpenAI will likely keep search ad-free for about a year to build a solid user base before introducing paid ads, Google’s core business model that OpenAI now aims to challenge.

24,25,"Is AGI Already Here? 

Unveiling the Hidden Steps Behind OpenAI and Microsoft’s Power Play

Motivated by the community’s positive feedback on my recent comments to Linas Beliūnas’s article “OpenAI Drama,” I felt compelled to delve deeper into the unfolding narrative between OpenAI and Microsoft.

The drama surrounding OpenAI and Microsoft is starting to feel like a corporate soap opera, but let’s not get too swept up in the hype. 

Recent developments like OpenAI’s introduction of real-time search capabilities for ChatGPT have certainly stirred excitement in the AI community. This feature allows the AI to access up-to-date information, making interactions more relevant and timely. It’s a significant step forward, but it’s important to see it for what it is: an incremental improvement, not a quantum leap toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).

While the notion of an ‘AGI achieved’ loophole sounds dramatic, the reality is that we’re still miles away from an artificial general intelligence that could match, let alone surpass, the human brain. 

Despite rumors about GPT-5 progress, there has been no official confirmation from OpenAI about its development or capabilities. Speculation is natural in such a rapidly evolving field, but we should be cautious not to conflate unverified rumors with concrete advancements.

No development team, however brilliant, is about to crack that code unless the next Einstein or Turing “suddenly” shows up with a solution. 

The advancements we’re witnessing —like improved language models and enhanced features — are built upon existing technologies and represent steady progress rather than groundbreaking shifts.

At best, this is a power play — a legal dance to renegotiate terms and control infrastructure. Companies are leveraging their innovations to gain strategic advantages, but let’s be clear: even if AGI were a reality, it wouldn’t be contained by any contract. AGI, by its nature, would rewrite the rules, transcending any corporate agreements or legal frameworks.

So, all this maneuvering is just the opening act of a much longer and more complex story. 

As for now? Enjoy the popcorn, but don’t hold your breath. The journey toward AGI seems to be a marathon, not a sprint, and while the tech world buzzes with excitement over each new feature, it’s important to maintain a grounded perspective amid the speculation.

However, we cannot exclude the possibility that AGI is being developed behind the scenes and introduced gradually through seemingly unrelated projects. New capabilities are being integrated step by step, requiring adoption by existing businesses to become truly impactful.

What are your thoughts on the current state of AI advancements? 

Do you believe we’re closer to achieving AGI than it appears, or is it all just incremental progress?

- Access a knowledge base featuring SK-II and Shiseido product catalogs
- Analyze precisely your skin with Claude

Except Elon Musk.

He had founded OpenAI. He had funded OpenAI.

He wanted to be the visionary who brought AI into the world.

Instead, he had to leave OpenAI after a power struggle.

So, he started another AI company and decided to beat OpenAI.

Thus, xAI was born.

Beating OpenAI was an impossible goal.

They had more funding, researchers, GPUs, products, and users. They were years ahead in every respect.

But doing impossible stuff was Elon Musk’s speciality.

First, he got the data. His companies, Tesla and Twitter, had tons of proprietary data. He got it to xAI, for training a new AI model called Grok.

He also cut off OpenAI’s access to Twitter.

He hired Igor Babuschkin, ex-Google’s DeepMind and ex-OpenAI, to build the new AI.

Nvidia GPUs were out of stock everywhere. So Elon called his friend Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle, and got access to a huge number of Oracle GPUs.

He also diverted 12,000 Nvidia GPUs from Tesla to xAI.

Then, he started building a huge data centre in Memphis called Colossus.

He didn’t have time for lengthy construction planning. He decided to deal with problems on the fly.

When they didn’t get approval for power, they put natural gas generators in the parking lot.

By early September, Colossus came online.

It was built in a record 122 days instead of the usual 7-8 months.

Today, xAI is valued at $50 billion, making it the second biggest AI company, after OpenAI.

It has $11 billion in funding and 1 lakh Nvidia chips, and they plan to double this number soon.

27,28,"🚨 BIG: many didn't notice, but The 🇮🇹 Italian Data Protection Authority has just caused a massive EARTHQUAKE in the field of AI. Read below the formal WARNING it sent to a publisher after it closed a licensing deal with OpenAI:

""Privacy guarantor to Gedi: be careful about selling personal data contained in the newspaper archive to OpenAI so that it can use them to train algorithms

The digital archives of newspapers store the stories of millions of people, with information, details, personal data, even extremely sensitive, that cannot be licensed for use by third parties to train AI, without due precautions.

If the Gedi Group, by virtue of the agreement signed last September 24 with OpenAI, communicated to the latter the personal data contained in its archive, it could violate the provisions of the EU Regulation, with all the consequences, including sanctions, provided for by the legislation.

This is, in short, the formal warning that the Privacy Guarantor has sent to Gedi and to all the companies (Gedi News Network Spa, Gedi Periodi e Servizi Spa, Gedi Digital Srl, Monet Srl and Alfemminile Srl) that are part of the agreement for the communication of editorial content stipulated with OpenAI. The measure was adopted after the first feedback provided by the company, as part of the investigation recently launched by the Authority.

Based on the information received, the Authority believes that the processing activities are intended to involve a large volume of personal data, including of a particular nature and of a judicial nature, and that the impact assessment, carried out by the company and transmitted to the Guarantor, does not sufficiently analyze the legal basis by virtue of which the publisher could transfer or license for use by third parties the personal data present in its archive to OpenAI, so that it can process them to train its algorithms.

Finally, the warning measure highlights how the information and transparency obligations towards the interested parties do not appear to have been sufficiently fulfilled and that Gedi is not in a position to guarantee the latter the rights they are entitled to under European privacy legislation, in particular the right to object.""

*Automatic translation from Italian to English

➡️ The Italian DPA is saying that:
→ The licensing deal is potentially unlawful;
→ Other business models behind LLMs might also be unlawful, as basic data protection obligations and rights are likely not being respected.

➡️ Licensing deals were one of the big bets in solving AI copyright issues. If licensing becomes unlawful from a data protection perspective (in the EU), we're back to square one.

➡️ What might happen:
→ The publishers' lawyers might formally answer;
→ Other EU DPAs might follow suit (😱).

Also, for the record, Google is busy working away at their own AI snapshots, which I also use at times, but have really shifted my starting point elsewhere.

What's new? Perplexity has launched a new AI-powered search assistant. Highlights:

1️⃣ Starting point: You can start from the situation and what products you need for this situation. Example: ""I am throwing a Thanksgiving dinner party at my house for 6. What items do I need?"" Now, for the record, you can do that now as a free user of Perplexity as I did. I would have included a video but LinkedIn doesn't allow for 2 videos in a carousel. What's different now is a ""Buy with Pro"" button that allows you to complete the transaction without leaving Perplexity's site including managing the payment and storing your credit card information. They also offer free shipping on whatever you buy there. Me likey.

2️⃣ You can take a picture of something to purchase it. I like this one for those situations when you're in store and wondering if there is a better price somewhere else. For the record, as a free user, Perplexity would only allow me to attach a pdf and when I did so of a water bottle on my desk, it responded, ""I don't have the answer to your query about where to buy the product, as the search results did not provide any relevant information.""  I tried ChatGPT with the same photo and it said, ""I'm happy to help you find the water bottle you're looking for. However, I need more details to assist you accurately. Could you please provide the brand, model, or a description of the water bottle? If you have a link or image, that would be helpful too."" For the record, I had just attached the image. Anthropic's Claude responded back ""You can buy this water bottle on the GRIP6 website. The image shows a water bottle with motivational text and time markings, which appears to be a product sold by the GRIP6 brand."" without any link to purchase and that was the incorrect water bottle. 👎 Amazon's Rufus AI-assistant and Google were both spot on and produced a link to the water bottle immediately. ⭐️👏

So, in sum, I do like this user experience, per the starting point, and think it is much more native as a shopper BUT, I do see some immediate issues in fidelity that need to be addressed to scale.

OpenAI is officially now stepping into the ring with Google Search 🤯

34,35,"""AI is hyped up. It often gives irrelevant, low-quality answers for my business"".

Really? AI is many things, but the last time I checked, telepathy definitely wasn’t on the list.

To get the best results from your AI, you need to give it context. The more context you provide, the better the response. With OpenAI’s latest live search feature, it’s now even easier to bring more context into a chat. 

Let me break it down:

The quickest way to add context—and probably the most common—is to return to a previous chat window. But this does have its limits.

The next level is creating GPTs tailored to specific business needs, like a proposal-writing GPT or a customer service GPT.

And then there’s:
- Document uploads
- Accessing Office 365 and Google Drive

And the big one: with the latest release, you can now click the search icon and instruct your AI to pull in live information from the web!

All of this points to OpenAI’s focus on streamlining data access, shifting away from lengthy prompts. The ultimate goal is to help users quickly bring highly relevant context into the chat, enabling better outcomes.

38,39,"Even Jensen Huang says “today's AI doesn't provide the best answers. ""We have to get to a point where the answer that you get, you largely trust. The CEO said we're still several years away and that companies will need more computational power.” But the problem is that the “computational “law” that previously enabled better answers, and that made Nvidia the world’s most valuable company, is starting to break down. “This is not the famous Moore’s Law, the semiconductor industry maxim that chip performance will increase by doubling transistor density every two years.” This is a type of scaling for which there is very little evidence that it exists.

“For many in Silicon Valley, Moore’s Law has been displaced as the dominant
predictor of technological progress by a new concept: the “scaling law” of artificial intelligence. This posits that putting more data into a bigger #AI model — in turn, requiring more computing power — delivers smarter systems. This insight put a rocket under AI’s progress, transforming the focus of development from solving tough science problems to the more straightforward engineering challenge of building ever-bigger clusters of chips — usually Nvidia’s.”

The scaling law had its coming-out moment with the launch of ChatGPT. The breakneck pace of improvement in AI systems in the two years since then seemed to suggest the rule might hold true right until we reach some kind of “super intelligence”, perhaps within this decade. 

And this this “scaling law hypothesis fuelled fear of missing out on the next big tech transition, leading to unprecedented investment by Big Tech on AI. Capital expenditures at Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google are set to exceed $200bn this year and top $300bn next year, and nobody wants to be last to build super intelligence.”

Over the past month, however, industry rumblings have grown louder that the latest models from the likes of OpenAI, Google and Anthropic have not shown the expected improvements in line with the scaling law’s projections.

Now, AI executives, researchers and investors are conceding that AI model capabilities are — as Marc Andreessen put it on his podcast — “topping out” on pre-training alone, meaning that more work is required after the model is built to keep the advances coming.

Other #tech leaders are also backing down from optimistic forecasts. “Some of the scaling law’s earliest adherents such as Microsoft chief Satya Nadella, have attempted to recast its definition. It doesn’t matter if pre-training yields shrinking returns, defenders argue, because models can now reason when asked a complex question. “We are seeing the emergence of a new scaling law, Nadella said recently, referring to OpenAI’s new o1 model.”

But this kind of fudging should make Nvidia’s investors nervous,” because there is no evidence that OpenAI’s new o1 model can reason.

41,42,"Introducing llmfsd: A game-changer for Structured Data Generation with LLMs 

I’m thrilled to announce the launch of llmfsd, a Python package now available on PyPI! This project empowers developers, data scientists, and researchers to seamlessly generate fake structured data using SQL-like queries.

Why did I create llmfsd ?
Modern workflows demand structured data for testing, prototyping, and development. However, while LLMs excel at generating text, bridging the gap between unstructured and structured data has always been a challenge. llmfsd was created to solve this problem by providing a simple, flexible and efficient way to create structured data with LLMs.

You can directly get the output or save it to a file (saving to a file is recommended to reduce token consumption).

llmfsd works with LLMs from Mistral AI, OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and more via aisuite (thanks, Andrew Ng).

To get started run: pip install llmfsd. 

The project is available on my GitHub and is waiting for your contributions!

42,43,"Mostly in America: you start work, they give you shares of the company. They tell you that if you work hard and this thing works, everyone can have a great Christmas, Diwala, Salah, etc depending on your call. And just like that, the game begins. Those shares at $10 could jump to $40, and they buy them back from you - and as that happens, there will be money everywhere. People, it is always a big rain, and when it happens at scale, financial liberation comes.

OpenAI employees are experiencing a major rain as Softbank comes with a truckload of cash to buy them out: “In a significant development for employees and investors, OpenAI is offering a new tender opportunity for current and former employees to sell approximately $1.5 billion worth of shares to SoftBank”. Most of those shares will be employee stock options which Softbank can convert, via OpenAI, to common full shares even as some with common shares (a super minority in this case) exit. In other words, SoftBank is creating liquidity to enable OpenAI to exit some shareholders and also put cash in the pockets of workers.

Say it another way: many $millionaires will be minted when this deal closes. And many of them will retire or leave the company for their passions. And that is the risk for OpenAI there: if people become rich that money is no more a motivator, many bad things happen as those cubicles could become empty.  But for all humans, it is a good problem for society because abundance will be scaled <URL>",0,,

52,53,"It’s a breathtaking competition! OpenAI’s recent release of a search feature within ChatGPT is a daring step that has caught the attention of users and industry leaders like Google, Microsoft, and Perplexity.

This move from OpenAI signals a shift in the search landscape, traditionally controlled by Google’s algorithms and Microsoft’s Bing. Search is evolving beyond simple keyword-matching to become more interactive, generative, and context-aware.

The integration of real-time web search into ChatGPT improves user experience with direct information, citations, and source links. This level of transparency helps address the ‘black-box’ nature of large language models.

Additionally, OpenAI’s collaborations with media outlets bring an added layer of trust.

Perplexity has also introduced a user-centric search model with a straightforward interface that allows users to limit queries to specific sources. OpenAI’s new model builds on this approach, introducing verification and personalization.

While Google remains powerful, it faces a crucial challenge: can it adapt its ad-driven model to a world where users prefer AI-driven, ad-free answers? Microsoft’s integration of ChatGPT into Bing shows how traditional search and generative AI can be combined, but OpenAI’s native feature heightens the competition.

The rise of AI-driven search challenges Google’s advertising-based model. With a growing preference for direct, ad-free answers, Google and others might need to rethink their monetization, perhaps shifting toward more subtle ads or subscription options.

Is OpenAI poised to dethrone Google search? Not yet. Google’s extensive user base still gives it an edge, though OpenAI is raising the bar with transparent, contextually rich answers.

The industry is at a turning point. Will Google adapt swiftly? Can Microsoft capitalize on its partnership with OpenAI?

One thing is certain: competition is heating up, and users are poised to benefit from a new era in which search is more than just a tool.",0,,

54,55,"Let me give you a different perspective on ""David Mayer"".


When you request information about ""David Mayer"" in the prompt or indirectly, ChatGPT or the infrastructures that this API system is registered to refuse to respond. You always get the answer ""I am unable to..."".

Isn't this very interesting?

I am talking about a system where you can get malware code with escape mechanisms, that can give any risky information without hesitation when necessary, that has many manipulative versions on the Dark Web, and that even offers poisonous recipes, and that is in high demand worldwide.

The structure in front of you can easily block the information you want with a single ""click"".

Many speculative answers about this so-called ""bug"" are circulating on the internet. When you try every technical or non-technical possibility on the internet, you understand that the ""David Mayer"" case is unique. While you can get an answer when you query the names of even the most dangerous people in the world, you cannot get an answer about this name and the questions it contains, but I will leave these aside and give you a different perspective I want to.

The main issue here is freedom of information. The ""David Mayer"" case is a definitive proof that OpenAI and its affiliates can ban content that you want to request and learn about a person, a group, a structure.

Algorithmically, the system in front of you blocks a detail you want to learn, shapes it as it wishes, and can manipulate the information it gives you if it is compatible with its agenda. Isn't the evidence sufficient?

The ""David Mayer"" ban is clear evidence of this.

This system in front of you can, one day or another, block, ban or distort the name of a government official, the name of an artist, the life of an activist, or a clear truth itself.

Whether you call it ""David Mayer"" or ""John Doe""...
It doesn't matter.

The reason for this ban may be a ""bug"" or an ""agenda"".
The real question is what the result is.

Haven't we always discussed the freedom and validity of information?

You can't even guess how many articles, how many contents, how many concise sentences, how many official documents were prepared with ChatGPT.

But how many of them are really true?

Even if you try to translate the content of this post into any language on ChatGPT, you will be blocked again.

Technological hegemony has no mercy or equality, it has an agenda.


Think about it this way too.
Your information, friends!

For the last few months we have heard from Sam Altman that AGI (whatever it means) is closer than ever. Based on the last generation of NVIDIA GPUs and having access to more data, we will see an explosion of GPT capabilities. Sam called gpt-4 the dumbest model….

On the other side, folks like Yann LeCun has always stated any significant advance on LLMs will come from new architecture approaches like JEPA that could potentially overcome the limitations transformers have evidenced.

The truth is, according to recent comments, OpenAI could potentially develop new strategies as more data and more compute are not enough. New gpt model improvement would be significant lower comparing to the jump we experimented from gpt-3 to gpt-4.

62,63,"So many talks on useless ChatGPT features, but I didn't see even one post about new update of OpenAI's APIs: now you can get a structured response from some GPT models

What's even better, if you use Pydantic -  you can dump your class as a response schema and it will return you response using that class

Why does this matter? Well, if you want to get structured output from LLM - this is a pain in the ass, cuz there are almost always cases when it fails and you need to handle all of them. If you are in production - this is really really annoying (telling you as a person who's trying to do it for the past 2 years). This feature solves huge problem for developers who want to integrate LLMs in their apps

This feature is still in beta tho and available only for some models, but I'm really waiting for alfa release

63,64,"I've helped some of the largest corporations in the world build their venturing units and CVCs. 

There is no question - it's essential for large corporations to work and partner with startups. 

If we want to accelerate and scale technologies like AI, climate technologies, bio and healthcare, there is no other way. 

However, there is a big gap between what startups need in order to grow and what corporates have to offer in additional to capital to help them grow. 

In many cases, the strategic investment is not really strategic at all and it adds no value sometimes even negative value. 

One of the biggest challenges CVCs and strategic investors is to find value creation mechanisms as part of their selling point to get into deal with successful startups. 

In my view, before corporates think about investing in startups, or a part of the process to become real strategic value adding investors, they should build products and services to startups. 

If corporates make startups and founders their customers, and build something for them, they will have no choice but to understand deeply what their startup customers need to scale. They will have no choice but to speak directly with founders, their investors. 

Some of the great examples of this strategy are the big tech companies. Amazon has AWS, Google has GCP and Microsoft has AZURE. Cloud services and the application layers that are built within are the driving forces that help startups grow and scale at low cost and fast. A big use case is the deal of Microsoft with OpenAI and now of Amazon in Anthropic, the value is not only with cash, but in credits for their cloud services and other benefits in terms of locations of data centers for better compute power usage and efficiency. 

It's true, in industries like automotive, energy and even medical this might be difficult for the corporates to find the products that could be for startups as customers, but if they do, that will make corporations extremely valuable and attractive strategic investors to the startups in their space.

65,66,"🔍 Search the Web with ChatGPT 🌐

Continuously adding new functionalities to ChatGPT (file upload, code interpreter, voice…), OpenAI has made (intentionally or not), many applications “wrapping” around its underlying LLMs obsolete.

The recently launched web “Search” might be different, and a deliberate attempt to compete with Perplexity - and even with Google.

As this very short demo shows, ChatGPT can now not only conduct online searches and reference sources  - it can do so as a Chrome extension bypassing Google. 

Google already launched a competing “grounding” tool in its AI Studio, so it will be interesting to see how Perplexity responds, and how this competition might benefit school leaders, teachers, and students alike.

67,68,"While OpenAI and Anthropic grab headlines, this 25-year-old AI company just pulled off the smartest pivot I've seen.

Meet Appen - the company that's been quietly powering AI development since before ChatGPT was even a concept.

But here's where it gets interesting...

Facing intense competition from flashy AI startups, they didn't just update their logo - they completely reimagined their identity.

The transformation? From ""data annotation company"" to ""AI confidence partner.

""Our team at Laetro took on this massive challenge with a three-phase approach that would make even the most seasoned brand strategists sweat.

First, we uncovered a golden insight: Appen's real strength wasn't just in data annotation - it was in making AI trustworthy through human expertise. 

While other companies were racing to build the fastest AI, Appen was focused on building the most reliable AI.

This became our north star for the entire rebrand. 

We developed a visual identity that screams ""premium tech"" while maintaining the gravitas of a company that's been in the game for a quarter of a century.

The centerpiece? A striking 'A' monogram that captures both their heritage and their future vision. 

We backed it with a sophisticated black and white palette, punctuated with confident blue accents that stand out in a sea of tech-brand sameness.

The results? A brand that finally matches Appen's actual market position - not just as a service provider but as a crucial player in the future of responsible AI.

Major kudos to our dream team - Michael Lin, Ken Frederick, Sam Frentzel-Beyme, and James Hart for pushing the boundaries of a B2B tech brand.

And to Fab Dolan at Appen - thanks for trusting us with your company's future.

O2’s AI Granny Daisy Harris Takes On Phone Scammers 📞
Meet Daisy Harris, O2 UK’s AI-powered grandmother, here to waste scammer’s time in the most charming way possible. Think of her as the ultimate ""scambaiter""—she’s confused, a bit too friendly, and loves talking about tea, biscuits, and birds. The best part? She doesn't need to sleep! In one call, she managed to keep scammers on the line for nearly an hour, all while they tried to get her to type ""www"" into a browser. While it’s a fun way to disrupt scammers, experts still advise: just hang up and report it! But honestly, can we blame Daisy for making their day just a little bit more... annoying? 😆

Celebrating ChatGPT’s 2nd Anniversary 🎉

70,71,"Developers often face significant challenges when integrating large language models (LLMs) from different providers due to fragmented APIs and configurations. To address this, Andrew Ng’s team has introduced AISuite, an open-source Python library that streamlines the integration of LLMs across providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama. AISuite enables developers to switch between models with a simple “provider:model” string (e.g., openai:gpt-4o or anthropic:claude-3-5), eliminating the need for extensive code rewrites.

When I sat down with VCs focused on AI, their amazement matched mine. They were impressed that we’ve built our own AI with our own team, rather than relying solely on tools like OpenAI or Google APIs. In a space where 90% of AI startups use pre-existing platforms, this distinction stood out.

There’s nothing wrong with applying AI to create value—many startups do it brilliantly—but it’s clear we’re talking about two very different skill sets:
- Applying AI: Innovating through existing tools.
- Building AI: Creating the models and systems that push boundaries.

Both approaches are vital, but they deserve separate recognition. As the AI field grows, perhaps it’s time to celebrate these unique contributions in their own compartments.

For founders, the real magic is in creating something remarkable, not in chasing popularity. 💫

First, I tried Claude. Claude, lacking the capability of chain of thought reasoning, made a mistake that you can see below. Here it assumed that Mr. Brown is just lying about him being Mr. Brown. This is clearly not what the problem statement said..

However, both Deepseek and GPT-O1-Preview created scenarios and then eliminated the incorrect ones in a step-by-step manner. Openai's O1-preview got the answer in 18 ms whereas Deepseek took 22 seconds. So, it is still lagging behind the Openai's model, but the best part is Deepseek is open sourced (<URL> 

Biggest hurdle behind o1-preview's adoption was the latency and the cost, but, with an open sourced and not too slow of a model, I think we are going to see a lot of opportunities for business tasks that need sequential reasoning. Personally, I think that such a model will be the best orchestrator for an multi-agent LLM systems and such approaches can make agentic AI adoption much more feasible.

Some time ago OpenAI published Swarm: an educational framework for building multi-agent systems.

Their approach focuses on two main concepts:
・ 𝐑𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬: Each agent follows specific 📜 instructions and uses 🛠️ tools to execute them.
・ 𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐟𝐟𝐬 🤝: Agents can transfer control to one another using tool/function calling.


When I first read these ideas, I thought: 𝘴𝘪𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘦 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘱𝘰𝘸𝘦𝘳𝘧𝘶𝘭! And they pair well with the recent unified tool support in Haystack.

88,89,"Excited to share my project submission for BlueDot Impact's AI Safety Fundamentals course! GovSearch: A RAG chatbot that helps folks find and understand legislation using natural language.

Under the hood, it's a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) chatbot that combines GPT-4, vector search, and embeddings to make legislative research more intuitive. 

For those who might remember, last year Alex and I created a custom GPT named ""Parliamentarian GPT"" using OpenAI's custom GPT feature, connected to the GovInfo API. We've come a long way! Unlike our first iteration, there is no more slow exact-match searches - just ask questions in plain English and get relevant bills explained clearly.

Special thanks to Tyler Newman on helping me with this iteration's technical aspects, and seeing where we needed to go while breaking down complex concepts in accessible ways.

To my friends and colleagues, try it out! The best way to understand AI governance is to see where these systems succeed and fail firsthand.

Huge thanks to Elise Racine, and Luke Drago at BlueDot Impact for teaching me the broader implications of AI governance. And shout out to my cohort friends Maryama, Joe, and Aaron. 

If you are interested, I highly recommend BlueDot Impact's 12-week course (its free!). 

And to anyone with ideas for similar tools, building RAG chatbots are more accessible than you might think, thanks to Vercel! Let's link and build.

92,93,"🚀 Exploring LLM Applications: NFL Recap Chatbot 🚀
As part of my journey in learning about large language models, I recently built a fun project to combine AI and football storytelling. Here’s what it does:
1️⃣ Interactive Chat Interface with Gradio
I used Gradio to create a sleek interface where users can input their favorite NFL game.
2️⃣ Dynamic Song Creation with OpenAI
The chatbot processes game details and generates a custom song summarizing the highlights—bringing football moments to life in a creative way.
3️⃣ Efficient Output and Presentation
Designed for quick responses, the chatbot demonstrates how large language models can process structured inputs and deliver engaging, user-friendly outputs.
This project was an exciting way to reinforce concepts from my LLM class while having some fun during Thanksgiving! It’s incredible to see how AI tools like Gradio and OpenAI can simplify the process of building engaging applications.

Again, shoutout to Ed Donner for his amazing LLM class on Udemy. I'm 25% through the course and I feel like I have learned so much already! Can't wait to see what's in store for the next week of classes!

99,100,"OpenAI is building custom AI chips. What’s your business building?

Here’s the thing: AI is expensive. Training large models like GPT-4 doesn’t just cost millions—it burns through cash faster than a toddler in a toy store.

So, OpenAI has a solution: “Let’s build our own chips.”

It’s like owning the farm instead of buying the milk. Cheaper. Scalable. Genius.

Now, before you think, “Cool story, but I don’t run a chip factory,” 

ask yourself:

What are you spending too much on?

What could you own or control instead of outsourcing?

Where’s your scalable edge?


Businesses don’t need custom chips, but they do need custom strategies.

Maybe for you, it’s building an in-house team instead of relying on expensive freelancers. Or creating a proprietary process that competitors can’t copy.

The takeaway? Don’t just play the game. Find your edge. Build your “chip.”

💡 What’s the one thing you could build to lower costs and scale smarter? Let’s brainstorm in the comments.

The most interesting thing in AI Recruitment today...

OpenAI is gearing up to launch 'Operator' in January - an AI that can actually DO things for you, not just chat about them! 

But here's what's REALLY fascinating... 🤔

While everyone's focused on the ""book my flight"" features, I reckon this is the start of something much bigger:

1️⃣ This marks a seismic shift in how companies will need to hire AI talent. We're moving from 'model builders' to 'AI orchestrators' who can design systems that safely interact with real-world services.

2️⃣ The talent war is heating up! Anthropic, Microsoft, and Google are all racing to launch similar tools. I'm tracking a 47% increase in job postings mentioning AI Agents since September.

3️⃣ Most intriguingly, Sam Altman called this ""the next giant breakthrough"" - not model improvements. That's a MASSIVE hint about where the industry is heading.

🎯 My prediction? The companies that win won't be those with the smartest AI, but those with the safest, most reliable execution.

The real question: How will this reshape the AI talent landscape in 2025? 🤔

106,107,"Bon lundi, mes amis 🇫🇷. This week for my #MondaysWithEric I add a little international flair with a mention of Mistral AI and #LeChat today. I've been playing around with it, plus #GoogleGemini on iOS 📱and have thoughts.

Sure, I spend a lot of time in OpenAI's #ChatGPT and Anthropic's #Claude these days, but that doesn't mean I'm not testing other models to see what's working and how things are improving. 

🇫🇷 𝗟𝗲𝗖𝗵𝗮𝘁 is by Mistral is a free model out of France that provides a great experience. It's default model is current as of September 2023, but you can use the Web Search option to connect to current results. However, a quick search for current weather conditions for Houghton Lake, MI said 78 degrees and sunny. Yeah, I wish. 

It also has a ""canvas"" feature for more of a collaborative way of exploring your results - as well as an image generation feature that's not too shabby. 

📱 𝗚𝗲𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶 on iOS has to be used via a ""free"" Google account for now, so I've had to resort to my Gmail account to play around with it. But unlike LeChat, it does offer a voice interface on mobile - and you can pick the voice options, which is nice. Once they support my Workplace account I'll likely spend more time trying to customize the process, adding memory items, etc.

I did some testing with it over the weekend and had some nice ""conversations"" about Sunday's football games 🏈. It seemed to have recent results in the tests that I performed when asking about current sores and rankings, and the flow of the conversation seemed very natural (and enjoyable). 

What about you? Are there any others that you're playing with these days worth mentioning. The thing that I've found is just when you think things are ""all set"" one of the platforms makes a jump and gets better, or a new player steps on the field (yeah, keeping with my football theme from the weekend).",1,,

Yes, it’s already 2 years since OpenAI launched #ChatGPT on November 30, 2022! 🚀 Today, it still holds the title of the fastest-growing consumer application.
📈 Within just 5 days, the chatbot attracted over 1 million users, and by January 2023, the estimated number of users skyrocketed to 100 million. 🤯

Sam Altman is pushing to make OpenAI a for-profit company (Doing this  + limited transparency was allegedly one of the reasons the Board tried to let him go some time ago).

 Financial Times has just published an article about how the #genAI company is hunting for top advertising talents from social media companies.

What to expect? Why? 

👉 Adoption of ChatGPT stagnated a few months back, which means subscriptions are unlikely to generate the required revenue streams.

Can ads help? What this could mean? 
1️⃣ Sponsored #chatgpt responses - I’m afraid that if ChatGPT’s responses are influenced by advertisers, the results will be the exact opposite of what OpenAI, initially a non-profit, was founded to achieve.

2️⃣  On top of that, ChatGPT still has around 1/50 of the monthly traffic that Google Search sees, and AI is an expensive business to run. Not to mention the fact that ads work best with video content.

122,123,"This could be huge! Elon Musk's xAI is reportedly pushing to release a consumer-facing AI app as soon as next month to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT 😳

Last valued at $50 billion, xAI is late to a highly competitive party. OpenAI, Google (Gemini), and Anthropic (Claude) all have better-known chatbots that have been widely available for consumers and businesses since at least last year. 

But here comes the interesting part.

According to WSJ, when pitching to potential employees and investors, Musk’s team touts two advantages in the race to build the most powerful AI:

(1) Exclusive data from X and Tesla being used to train xAI’s models.

(2) An obsessive focus on building bigger data centers faster than his competitors. 

Remember that in just 122 days, xAI built and brought “Colossus” online, which is now the world’s most powerful AI training cluster (100k of NVIDIA's H100s).

If they execute the same with Grok, the AI chatbot market could be seriously challenged ultimately benefiting the consumers.

Fascinating times.

132,133,"RL and RLHF are not all you need-- why RL on GPUs is just another brick in the wall of diminishing returns OpenAI does not want you to notice...

Let us start with a basic truth. Reinforcement Learning and its sibling RLHF (RL with human feedback) may be required for any system claiming actual cognition and not merely contextual inference. Why? Because cognition isnt just about recognizing patterns or regurgitating outputs. It is about acting based on feedback, adapting dynamically, and learning in ways that reflect a genuine understanding of goals, consequences, and context. RL can help model this process. It can interact with an environment, take actions, get rewards or corrections, and improve. RLHF extends this with human judgement further shaping agentic behavior.

But here is the thing. This theoretical foundation runs headfirst into a harsh reality when implemented on GPUs, the compute backbone of GenAI. While GPUs are phenomenal for training large models and accelerating dense calculations like matrix multiplication or anything that fits SIMD, they are not built for cognition. They choke on the very things that make RL and RLHF essential. Dynamic feedback, statedependent decisions, and sequential reasoning are all GPU bottlenecks. 

RL needs systems that can interact continuously with an environment, update state based on rewards, and adjust policies in real time. RLHF adds human guidance, sparse but critical, to refine behavior. Finetuning with human input is supposed to make systems smarter, but it introduces even more computational challenges. Adaptability becomes key and GPUs simply are not made for it.

GPUs are optimized for parallel, predictable operations. They shine in training massive neural networks, where everything can be batched and computed simultaneously. But RL and RLHF need sequential decision making, where each step depends on the one before it. That dependency breaks the parallel efficiency of GPUs. Feedback is NOT predictable. Sparse updates midcomputation bring everything to a halt. Dynamic logic creates thread divergence (GPU threads splitting into different paths) and memory overhead increases with every state update.

This is why even the simplest RL like implementations in systems like the OpenAI o1 model suffer from latency. Every time you interact with it, the lag isnt just the model processing your input. It is the GPU hamsters getting tired under the weight of a workflow it was never built for.

OpenAI and others have hit this wall too. Scaling up on GPUs wont fix RL limitations. It is inefficient, expensive, and energy intensive, delivering only marginal gains or diminishing returns. 

Cognition demands real time adaptability, sequential reasoning, and dynamic feedback. GPUs, for all their power, were not designed for this. GenAI today is all about expensive brute force, not authentic intelligence. 

It is not just a wall but a dead end.

We had a chat about how performance management is done at Wolt and Miro, the role of continuous feedback, and the importance of great leadership. And finally, how AI and software fit into that picture.

I was really impressed to hear how boldly companies like Miro and Wolt are going about this, and to hear about AI’s potential from the experts like Laura / OpenAI.

Find the full discussion on video in comments. Would love to hear comments and discuss the topics.

4 key takeaways:

360 reviews and performance rounds suck. The tooling built around the traditional perf processes serve employee evaluation, budgeting, and the organization’s point of view on performance, but don’t help individuals to develop their abilities.

Great leadership cannot be automated. I think Ewa put it well: leadership can only be learned through a lot of practice, and by honing your judgement. Great performance is not only improved by process, but by maintaining a culture that makes your organization great.

1-1 meetings are a key to coaching people, but leaders lack the time to prepare for them. Like Niilo said: no leader has the luxury to spend most of their time thinking about people's performance. You have to be smart with the time you have for it, and performance management has to be integrated into your existing workflow. AI can help here 🤖

140,141,"Last month, I wrote an article, working with Jalaj Jain and his expertise in legal aspects of things, and posted it up to Centre for AI Leadership (C4AIL)'s Intelligence Explorer through our Opinion section. Literally 1 week later, Open Source Initiative (OSI) came out and openly shared that open-sourced LLMs has a proper definition, and there is some potential abuse of the term by companies who claim their LLMs as ""open-source"".

With that, we answer the question: is Llama 3.2 truly open-source? While Meta claims it is, the reality is more nuanced. Unlike traditional open-source software that uses standard licenses like MIT or Apache 2.0, Llama 3.2 operates under a custom Community License Agreement (CLA). This CLA includes restrictions on commercial use and sublicensing, which does not align with conventional open-source definitions.

Interestingly, Llama 3.2 doesn't fully comply with the Open Source Initiative's draft Open Source AI Definition. However, it's important to note that compared to other leading AI models from companies like OpenAI and Google, Llama 3.2 offers significantly more openness and flexibility. This approach seems to mirror Google's Android strategy: sacrificing immediate licensing revenue to build a dominant ecosystem.

Meta's strategy with Llama 3.2 represents a calculated move to challenge closed-source competitors and potentially reshape the AI landscape. While it may not meet the strictest definitions of open-source, it's undeniably a step towards greater accessibility in AI. The question remains: Is this a positive direction for AI development, or does it fall short of true open-source principles? What are your thoughts on Meta's approach?

In an open letter titled “Dear Corporate AI Overlords,” accompanied by illustrations of figures raiding their middle fingers, the artists wrote that they’d been offered early access to Sora to test the product and be creative partners. Instead, they believe OpenAI wanted to use hundreds of unpaid AI artists like them for the purpose of “art washing” an exploitative business model.
“Hundreds of artists provide unpaid labor through bug testing, feedback and experimental work for the program for a $150B valued company,” the group wrote on the AI model-hosting platform Hugging Face. “While hundreds contribute for free, a select few will be chosen through a competition to have their Sora-created films screened—offering minimal compensation which pales in comparison to the substantial PR and marketing value OpenAI receives.” The letter was authored by 16 artists who said they weren’t opposed to the use of AI as an artistic tool—in fact, many of them are early adopters of AI in their work—but they felt the need to protest against an early access program that appeared to be a public relations ploy rather than an opportunity to freely experiment with and critique the tool. Any videos they created using the tool had to be approved by OpenAI before being shared, they said.
“What we don’t agree with is how this artist program has been rolled out and how the tool is shaping up ahead of a possible public release,” the group wrote. “We are sharing this to the world in the hopes that OpenAI becomes more open, more artist-friendly and supports the arts beyond PR stunts.”"" Source: <URL>",2,,
149,150,"OpenAI’s secret video model leaked—and it’s sparking a revolution 🤯

The internet went wild when an AI tool was free for 3 hours. 

OpenAI’s new video generation model, SORA, was leaked online by a group called Angry Artists.

 For three hours, the model was freely available on Hugging Face before OpenAI managed to take it down.

Here's the crazy part: this model was in early access for select creators and artists, but the leaker posted it publicly with a bold message. 

Their letter, titled “Artists are not your unpaid R&D,” slammed OpenAI for putting AI tools behind paywalls instead of making them open for everyone.

• The leak sparked a huge debate about AI accessibility and ethics.

• Many argued that AI tools should be available to everyone, not just a select few.

• Others worried about the implications of unrestricted access to powerful AI.

⇨ The Impact:

• OpenAI shut down early access for all creators in response.

• The Hugging Face space hosting SORA was removed.

• The leak's impact on AI policy and access continues to be felt.

⇨  Leveraging the Leak for Future Change:

Understanding the leak encourages us to think about AI accessibility and ethics. It teaches us to:

⇨  Advocate for open access to AI tools, promoting innovation and creativity.

⇨  Engage in debates about the ethical implications of AI technology.

⇨  Recognize the power dynamics in technology access and work towards more equitable solutions.

→ By consciously navigating these issues, we can drive meaningful change in the AI community, foster innovation, and enhance ethical standards.
