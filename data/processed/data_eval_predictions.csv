This is a huge reason why OpenAI is so far ahead despite having a fraction of the resources, with ChatGPT getting 15x more organic traffic than Google's Gemini.

Google is probably the most legendary tech company of all time, hiring the top 1% of engineers. OpenAI's strategy is to hire the top 1% of the top 1%.

When it comes to talent, the main ingredient isn't rocket science: If you pay more, you will get better people. This is how capitalism fundamentally works.

While Google hires rockstars, OpenAI hires rockstars among rockstars. This, combined with their leaner startup culture, allows them to get far more done.

13,"#Alibaba #QwQ Really Impresses at GPT-o1 Levels

#Two common debates in generative AI revolve around whether reasoning is the next frontier for foundation models and how competitive #Chinese models will be with those from the West. This week, a release from #Alibaba sheds light on both topics.

Since its initial release, #GPT-o1 has been regarded as the most sophisticated model for long-term reasoning tasks. 

The model validated several key ideas in generative AI, such as the shift from pretraining to inference. Since then, many models have aimed to match GPT-01’s performance in reasoning tasks. 

Somewhat surprisingly, the most interesting challengers have come from China. Last week, DEEPSEEK showcased its R1 model, which matched 
#GPT-01's performance across several reasoning benchmarks. This week, it was Alibaba’s turn.

Alibaba Group's latest addition to the #Qwen family, Qwen with Questions (QwQ), is making waves in the AI community as a strong open-source competitor to OpenAI's GPT-01 reasoning model. 

#QwQ, currently available in a #32-billion-parameter preview version with a 32,000-token context, has already demonstrated impressive capabilities in benchmark tests. In both the #AIME and #MATH benchmarks, which evaluate mathematical problem-solving abilities, QwQ outperforms GPT-o1-preview. 

This achievement highlights the model's strength in handling complex mathematical problems. Additionally, QwQ #surpasses GPT-01-mini on GPQA, a benchmark focused on scientific reasoning, further showcasing its proficiency in understanding and responding to scientific queries. While QwQ lags behind GPT-o1 in the LiveCodeBench coding benchmark, 
it still outperforms other frontier models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, solidifying its position as a strong contender in the large reasoning model (LRM) landscape.

Alibaba's philosophy behind QwQ emphasizes the importance of ""patient inquiry"" and ""thoughtful analysis"" in achieving true understanding. QwQ embodies this approach by engaging in a step-by-step reasoning process, akin to a student meticulously reviewing their work to identify and learn from mistakes. #Examples showcased on the Qwen website demonstrate QwQ's ability to ""think aloud,"" meticulously evaluating different possibilities and refining its approach as it tackles complex problems. 

#This transparency offers valuable insights into the model's reasoning mechanisms and underscores Alibaba's commitment to promoting a deeper understanding of #LRMs' functions.

18,"So after doing about 1.6k calls with one of our inbound systems, we wanted to analyse the conversations in some way, with goal to improve the current prompt or set up.

I tried putting in the transcripts excel sheet into ChatGPT in anonymous mode, but that doesn't go well with huge amounts of data as it makes quite a lot of mistakes. 

Then thought maybe I can make something in make . com but with ~1.6k rows, an iterator, openai module, then an update sheets module, thats at least ~4.8k ops just for all those conversations. 

Couple weeks back installed n8n on Render, and thought about giving that a go, and man its good! Ran all those rows with no cost per operation, only per whole scenario run. So I did it in batches of 100 or even 500 and it went sooo smooth 🔥

Anyway we learned that ~22% of the time the caller requests to speak to a specific team member, so we're going to do an upsell on that data. 

If you got any other ideas, or have some kind of other systems that can go through excel/sheets and analyse accurately, let me know pls! 💪

23,"Some great truth telling from Andrej Karpathy (former director of AI at Tesla and member of founding team at OpenAI). When we “ask an AI” about something or how to do something, we are effectively asking the data labeler who labeled this data and trained the AI to respond to this question with the labeled answer. This is not about “AI magic” but about good data labeling and training. The better we understand how AI and LLM’s work, the better we will be at setting our expectations and putting in place proper review and control workflows when using AI and LLM’s in legal work. They key to using AI in improving and accelerating legal work is to first understand what it is and how it works.

24,"And it’s finally here: OpenAI has launched its own AI search engine!

It combines Google’s search functionality with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Instead of giving you a list of links, it responds directly to your question in ChatGPT style, delivering one, concise answer. This isn’t just the top search result, but a synthesized answer based on all the information OpenAI has gathered.

The response includes links to relevant pages and a “source chip” showing all the sites ChatGPT consulted to generate the answer. You can even ask for images, flights, and more. The results are impressive so far.

To try it out, just click the globe icon in the ChatGPT text box.

In my opinion, this move is one of OpenAI’s strategic goals. They’ve been focused on attracting users over revenue to make ChatGPT users accustomed to the interface and responses. Transitioning AI users to a new search engine is easier than converting brand-new users. OpenAI will likely keep search ad-free for about a year to build a solid user base before introducing paid ads, Google’s core business model that OpenAI now aims to challenge.

A new chapter in the Google vs. OpenAI rivalry has begun!

25,"Is AGI Already Here? 

Unveiling the Hidden Steps Behind OpenAI and Microsoft’s Power Play

Motivated by the community’s positive feedback on my recent comments to Linas Beliūnas’s article “OpenAI Drama,” I felt compelled to delve deeper into the unfolding narrative between OpenAI and Microsoft.

The drama surrounding OpenAI and Microsoft is starting to feel like a corporate soap opera, but let’s not get too swept up in the hype. 

Recent developments like OpenAI’s introduction of real-time search capabilities for ChatGPT have certainly stirred excitement in the AI community. This feature allows the AI to access up-to-date information, making interactions more relevant and timely. It’s a significant step forward, but it’s important to see it for what it is: an incremental improvement, not a quantum leap toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).

While the notion of an ‘AGI achieved’ loophole sounds dramatic, the reality is that we’re still miles away from an artificial general intelligence that could match, let alone surpass, the human brain. 

Despite rumors about GPT-5 progress, there has been no official confirmation from OpenAI about its development or capabilities. Speculation is natural in such a rapidly evolving field, but we should be cautious not to conflate unverified rumors with concrete advancements.

No development team, however brilliant, is about to crack that code unless the next Einstein or Turing “suddenly” shows up with a solution. 

The advancements we’re witnessing —like improved language models and enhanced features — are built upon existing technologies and represent steady progress rather than groundbreaking shifts.

At best, this is a power play — a legal dance to renegotiate terms and control infrastructure. Companies are leveraging their innovations to gain strategic advantages, but let’s be clear: even if AGI were a reality, it wouldn’t be contained by any contract. AGI, by its nature, would rewrite the rules, transcending any corporate agreements or legal frameworks.

So, all this maneuvering is just the opening act of a much longer and more complex story. 

As for now? Enjoy the popcorn, but don’t hold your breath. The journey toward AGI seems to be a marathon, not a sprint, and while the tech world buzzes with excitement over each new feature, it’s important to maintain a grounded perspective amid the speculation.

However, we cannot exclude the possibility that AGI is being developed behind the scenes and introduced gradually through seemingly unrelated projects. New capabilities are being integrated step by step, requiring adoption by existing businesses to become truly impactful.

What are your thoughts on the current state of AI advancements? 

Do you believe we’re closer to achieving AGI than it appears, or is it all just incremental progress?

Except Elon Musk.

He had founded OpenAI. He had funded OpenAI.

He wanted to be the visionary who brought AI into the world.

Instead, he had to leave OpenAI after a power struggle.

So, he started another AI company and decided to beat OpenAI.

Thus, xAI was born.

Beating OpenAI was an impossible goal.

They had more funding, researchers, GPUs, products, and users. They were years ahead in every respect.

But doing impossible stuff was Elon Musk’s speciality.

First, he got the data. His companies, Tesla and Twitter, had tons of proprietary data. He got it to xAI, for training a new AI model called Grok.

He also cut off OpenAI’s access to Twitter.

He hired Igor Babuschkin, ex-Google’s DeepMind and ex-OpenAI, to build the new AI.

Nvidia GPUs were out of stock everywhere. So Elon called his friend Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle, and got access to a huge number of Oracle GPUs.

He also diverted 12,000 Nvidia GPUs from Tesla to xAI.

Then, he started building a huge data centre in Memphis called Colossus.

He didn’t have time for lengthy construction planning. He decided to deal with problems on the fly.

When they didn’t get approval for power, they put natural gas generators in the parking lot.

By early September, Colossus came online.

It was built in a record 122 days instead of the usual 7-8 months.

Today, xAI is valued at $50 billion, making it the second biggest AI company, after OpenAI.

It has $11 billion in funding and 1 lakh Nvidia chips, and they plan to double this number soon.

28,"🚨 BIG: many didn't notice, but The 🇮🇹 Italian Data Protection Authority has just caused a massive EARTHQUAKE in the field of AI. Read below the formal WARNING it sent to a publisher after it closed a licensing deal with OpenAI:

""Privacy guarantor to Gedi: be careful about selling personal data contained in the newspaper archive to OpenAI so that it can use them to train algorithms

The digital archives of newspapers store the stories of millions of people, with information, details, personal data, even extremely sensitive, that cannot be licensed for use by third parties to train AI, without due precautions.

If the Gedi Group, by virtue of the agreement signed last September 24 with OpenAI, communicated to the latter the personal data contained in its archive, it could violate the provisions of the EU Regulation, with all the consequences, including sanctions, provided for by the legislation.

This is, in short, the formal warning that the Privacy Guarantor has sent to Gedi and to all the companies (Gedi News Network Spa, Gedi Periodi e Servizi Spa, Gedi Digital Srl, Monet Srl and Alfemminile Srl) that are part of the agreement for the communication of editorial content stipulated with OpenAI. The measure was adopted after the first feedback provided by the company, as part of the investigation recently launched by the Authority.

Based on the information received, the Authority believes that the processing activities are intended to involve a large volume of personal data, including of a particular nature and of a judicial nature, and that the impact assessment, carried out by the company and transmitted to the Guarantor, does not sufficiently analyze the legal basis by virtue of which the publisher could transfer or license for use by third parties the personal data present in its archive to OpenAI, so that it can process them to train its algorithms.

Finally, the warning measure highlights how the information and transparency obligations towards the interested parties do not appear to have been sufficiently fulfilled and that Gedi is not in a position to guarantee the latter the rights they are entitled to under European privacy legislation, in particular the right to object.""

*Automatic translation from Italian to English

➡️ The Italian DPA is saying that:
→ The licensing deal is potentially unlawful;
→ Other business models behind LLMs might also be unlawful, as basic data protection obligations and rights are likely not being respected.

➡️ Licensing deals were one of the big bets in solving AI copyright issues. If licensing becomes unlawful from a data protection perspective (in the EU), we're back to square one.

➡️ What might happen:
→ The publishers' lawyers might formally answer;
→ Other EU DPAs might follow suit (😱).

32,"AI-Powered Search + Commerce. If your business isn't thinking about the transition from search on Google to LLMs, you're not thinking about the future. As someone who now has replaced about 50% of my search activity from Google to OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude, and Perplexity, I am usually the tip of the spear. Now, imagine that behavior at scale. It will come. For the record, I use the first 2 daily and the third in specific use cases where I need another lens on scouring the internet for sources outside OpenAI's online search tool for Pro users. Also, for the record, Google is busy working away at their own AI snapshots, which I also use at times, but have really shifted my starting point elsewhere.

What's new? Perplexity has launched a new AI-powered search assistant. Highlights:

1️⃣ Starting point: You can start from the situation and what products you need for this situation. Example: ""I am throwing a Thanksgiving dinner party at my house for 6. What items do I need?"" Now, for the record, you can do that now as a free user of Perplexity as I did. I would have included a video but LinkedIn doesn't allow for 2 videos in a carousel. What's different now is a ""Buy with Pro"" button that allows you to complete the transaction without leaving Perplexity's site including managing the payment and storing your credit card information. They also offer free shipping on whatever you buy there. Me likey.

2️⃣ You can take a picture of something to purchase it. I like this one for those situations when you're in store and wondering if there is a better price somewhere else. For the record, as a free user, Perplexity would only allow me to attach a pdf and when I did so of a water bottle on my desk, it responded, ""I don't have the answer to your query about where to buy the product, as the search results did not provide any relevant information.""  I tried ChatGPT with the same photo and it said, ""I'm happy to help you find the water bottle you're looking for. However, I need more details to assist you accurately. Could you please provide the brand, model, or a description of the water bottle? If you have a link or image, that would be helpful too."" For the record, I had just attached the image. Anthropic's Claude responded back ""You can buy this water bottle on the GRIP6 website. The image shows a water bottle with motivational text and time markings, which appears to be a product sold by the GRIP6 brand."" without any link to purchase and that was the incorrect water bottle. 👎 Amazon's Rufus AI-assistant and Google were both spot on and produced a link to the water bottle immediately. ⭐️👏

So, in sum, I do like this user experience, per the starting point, and think it is much more native as a shopper BUT, I do see some immediate issues in fidelity that need to be addressed to scale.

OpenAI is officially now stepping into the ring with Google Search 🤯

We all knew this day would come, but seeing it live is something else: look at the popup I just received when I opened ChatGPT!

What does this mean for the future of search? How might this reshape the entire digital ecosystem that's been built around Google’s dominance?",1,3,0.5380797386169434
35,"""AI is hyped up. It often gives irrelevant, low-quality answers for my business"".

Really? AI is many things, but the last time I checked, telepathy definitely wasn’t on the list.

To get the best results from your AI, you need to give it context. The more context you provide, the better the response. With OpenAI’s latest live search feature, it’s now even easier to bring more context into a chat. 

Let me break it down:

The quickest way to add context—and probably the most common—is to return to a previous chat window. But this does have its limits.

The next level is creating GPTs tailored to specific business needs, like a proposal-writing GPT or a customer service GPT.

And then there’s:
- Document uploads
- Accessing Office 365 and Google Drive

And the big one: with the latest release, you can now click the search icon and instruct your AI to pull in live information from the web!

All of this points to OpenAI’s focus on streamlining data access, shifting away from lengthy prompts. The ultimate goal is to help users quickly bring highly relevant context into the chat, enabling better outcomes.

39,"Even Jensen Huang says “today's AI doesn't provide the best answers. ""We have to get to a point where the answer that you get, you largely trust. The CEO said we're still several years away and that companies will need more computational power.” But the problem is that the “computational “law” that previously enabled better answers, and that made Nvidia the world’s most valuable company, is starting to break down. “This is not the famous Moore’s Law, the semiconductor industry maxim that chip performance will increase by doubling transistor density every two years.” This is a type of scaling for which there is very little evidence that it exists.

“For many in Silicon Valley, Moore’s Law has been displaced as the dominant
predictor of technological progress by a new concept: the “scaling law” of artificial intelligence. This posits that putting more data into a bigger #AI model — in turn, requiring more computing power — delivers smarter systems. This insight put a rocket under AI’s progress, transforming the focus of development from solving tough science problems to the more straightforward engineering challenge of building ever-bigger clusters of chips — usually Nvidia’s.”

The scaling law had its coming-out moment with the launch of ChatGPT. The breakneck pace of improvement in AI systems in the two years since then seemed to suggest the rule might hold true right until we reach some kind of “super intelligence”, perhaps within this decade. 

And this this “scaling law hypothesis fuelled fear of missing out on the next big tech transition, leading to unprecedented investment by Big Tech on AI. Capital expenditures at Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google are set to exceed $200bn this year and top $300bn next year, and nobody wants to be last to build super intelligence.”

Over the past month, however, industry rumblings have grown louder that the latest models from the likes of OpenAI, Google and Anthropic have not shown the expected improvements in line with the scaling law’s projections.

Now, AI executives, researchers and investors are conceding that AI model capabilities are — as Marc Andreessen put it on his podcast — “topping out” on pre-training alone, meaning that more work is required after the model is built to keep the advances coming.

Other #tech leaders are also backing down from optimistic forecasts. “Some of the scaling law’s earliest adherents such as Microsoft chief Satya Nadella, have attempted to recast its definition. It doesn’t matter if pre-training yields shrinking returns, defenders argue, because models can now reason when asked a complex question. “We are seeing the emergence of a new scaling law, Nadella said recently, referring to OpenAI’s new o1 model.”

But this kind of fudging should make Nvidia’s investors nervous,” because there is no evidence that OpenAI’s new o1 model can reason.

42,"Introducing llmfsd: A game-changer for Structured Data Generation with LLMs 

I’m thrilled to announce the launch of llmfsd, a Python package now available on PyPI! This project empowers developers, data scientists, and researchers to seamlessly generate fake structured data using SQL-like queries.

Why did I create llmfsd ?
Modern workflows demand structured data for testing, prototyping, and development. However, while LLMs excel at generating text, bridging the gap between unstructured and structured data has always been a challenge. llmfsd was created to solve this problem by providing a simple, flexible and efficient way to create structured data with LLMs.

You can directly get the output or save it to a file (saving to a file is recommended to reduce token consumption).

llmfsd works with LLMs from Mistral AI, OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and more via aisuite (thanks, Andrew Ng).

To get started run: pip install llmfsd. 

The project is available on my GitHub and is waiting for your contributions!

43,"Mostly in America: you start work, they give you shares of the company. They tell you that if you work hard and this thing works, everyone can have a great Christmas, Diwala, Salah, etc depending on your call. And just like that, the game begins. Those shares at $10 could jump to $40, and they buy them back from you - and as that happens, there will be money everywhere. People, it is always a big rain, and when it happens at scale, financial liberation comes.

OpenAI employees are experiencing a major rain as Softbank comes with a truckload of cash to buy them out: “In a significant development for employees and investors, OpenAI is offering a new tender opportunity for current and former employees to sell approximately $1.5 billion worth of shares to SoftBank”. Most of those shares will be employee stock options which Softbank can convert, via OpenAI, to common full shares even as some with common shares (a super minority in this case) exit. In other words, SoftBank is creating liquidity to enable OpenAI to exit some shareholders and also put cash in the pockets of workers.

Say it another way: many $millionaires will be minted when this deal closes. And many of them will retire or leave the company for their passions. And that is the risk for OpenAI there: if people become rich that money is no more a motivator, many bad things happen as those cubicles could become empty.  But for all humans, it is a good problem for society because abundance will be scaled <URL>",1,3,0.5320420861244202

53,"It’s a breathtaking competition! OpenAI’s recent release of a search feature within ChatGPT is a daring step that has caught the attention of users and industry leaders like Google, Microsoft, and Perplexity.

This move from OpenAI signals a shift in the search landscape, traditionally controlled by Google’s algorithms and Microsoft’s Bing. Search is evolving beyond simple keyword-matching to become more interactive, generative, and context-aware.

The integration of real-time web search into ChatGPT improves user experience with direct information, citations, and source links. This level of transparency helps address the ‘black-box’ nature of large language models.

Additionally, OpenAI’s collaborations with media outlets bring an added layer of trust.

Perplexity has also introduced a user-centric search model with a straightforward interface that allows users to limit queries to specific sources. OpenAI’s new model builds on this approach, introducing verification and personalization.

While Google remains powerful, it faces a crucial challenge: can it adapt its ad-driven model to a world where users prefer AI-driven, ad-free answers? Microsoft’s integration of ChatGPT into Bing shows how traditional search and generative AI can be combined, but OpenAI’s native feature heightens the competition.

The rise of AI-driven search challenges Google’s advertising-based model. With a growing preference for direct, ad-free answers, Google and others might need to rethink their monetization, perhaps shifting toward more subtle ads or subscription options.

Is OpenAI poised to dethrone Google search? Not yet. Google’s extensive user base still gives it an edge, though OpenAI is raising the bar with transparent, contextually rich answers.

The industry is at a turning point. Will Google adapt swiftly? Can Microsoft capitalize on its partnership with OpenAI?

One thing is certain: competition is heating up, and users are poised to benefit from a new era in which search is more than just a tool.",1,3,0.5355664491653442

When you request information about ""David Mayer"" in the prompt or indirectly, ChatGPT or the infrastructures that this API system is registered to refuse to respond. You always get the answer ""I am unable to..."".

When you try every technical or non-technical possibility on the internet, you understand that the ""David Mayer"" case is unique. While you can get an answer when you query the names of even the most dangerous people in the world, you cannot get an answer about this name and the questions it contains, but I will leave these aside and give you a different perspective I want to.

The main issue here is freedom of information. The ""David Mayer"" case is a definitive proof that OpenAI and its affiliates can ban content that you want to request and learn about a person, a group, a structure.

Algorithmically, the system in front of you blocks a detail you want to learn, shapes it as it wishes, and can manipulate the information it gives you if it is compatible with its agenda. Isn't the evidence sufficient?

The ""David Mayer"" ban is clear evidence of this.

This system in front of you can, one day or another, block, ban or distort the name of a government official, the name of an artist, the life of an activist, or a clear truth itself.

Whether you call it ""David Mayer"" or ""John Doe""...
It doesn't matter.

The reason for this ban may be a ""bug"" or an ""agenda"".
The real question is what the result is.

Haven't we always discussed the freedom and validity of information?

You can't even guess how many articles, how many contents, how many concise sentences, how many official documents were prepared with ChatGPT.

But how many of them are really true?

Even if you try to translate the content of this post into any language on ChatGPT, you will be blocked again.

Technological hegemony has no mercy or equality, it has an agenda.


Think about it this way too.
Your information, friends!

For the last few months we have heard from Sam Altman that AGI (whatever it means) is closer than ever. Based on the last generation of NVIDIA GPUs and having access to more data, we will see an explosion of GPT capabilities. Sam called gpt-4 the dumbest model….

On the other side, folks like Yann LeCun has always stated any significant advance on LLMs will come from new architecture approaches like JEPA that could potentially overcome the limitations transformers have evidenced.

The truth is, according to recent comments, OpenAI could potentially develop new strategies as more data and more compute are not enough. New gpt model improvement would be significant lower comparing to the jump we experimented from gpt-3 to gpt-4.

What's even better, if you use Pydantic -  you can dump your class as a response schema and it will return you response using that class

Why does this matter? Well, if you want to get structured output from LLM - this is a pain in the ass, cuz there are almost always cases when it fails and you need to handle all of them. If you are in production - this is really really annoying (telling you as a person who's trying to do it for the past 2 years). This feature solves huge problem for developers who want to integrate LLMs in their apps

This feature is still in beta tho and available only for some models, but I'm really waiting for alfa release

64,"I've helped some of the largest corporations in the world build their venturing units and CVCs. 

There is no question - it's essential for large corporations to work and partner with startups. 

If we want to accelerate and scale technologies like AI, climate technologies, bio and healthcare, there is no other way. 

However, there is a big gap between what startups need in order to grow and what corporates have to offer in additional to capital to help them grow. 

In many cases, the strategic investment is not really strategic at all and it adds no value sometimes even negative value. 

One of the biggest challenges CVCs and strategic investors is to find value creation mechanisms as part of their selling point to get into deal with successful startups. 

In my view, before corporates think about investing in startups, or a part of the process to become real strategic value adding investors, they should build products and services to startups. 

If corporates make startups and founders their customers, and build something for them, they will have no choice but to understand deeply what their startup customers need to scale. They will have no choice but to speak directly with founders, their investors. 

Some of the great examples of this strategy are the big tech companies. Amazon has AWS, Google has GCP and Microsoft has AZURE. Cloud services and the application layers that are built within are the driving forces that help startups grow and scale at low cost and fast. A big use case is the deal of Microsoft with OpenAI and now of Amazon in Anthropic, the value is not only with cash, but in credits for their cloud services and other benefits in terms of locations of data centers for better compute power usage and efficiency. 

It's true, in industries like automotive, energy and even medical this might be difficult for the corporates to find the products that could be for startups as customers, but if they do, that will make corporations extremely valuable and attractive strategic investors to the startups in their space.

Continuously adding new functionalities to ChatGPT (file upload, code interpreter, voice…), OpenAI has made (intentionally or not), many applications “wrapping” around its underlying LLMs obsolete.

The recently launched web “Search” might be different, and a deliberate attempt to compete with Perplexity - and even with Google.

As this very short demo shows, ChatGPT can now not only conduct online searches and reference sources  - it can do so as a Chrome extension bypassing Google. 

Google already launched a competing “grounding” tool in its AI Studio, so it will be interesting to see how Perplexity responds, and how this competition might benefit school leaders, teachers, and students alike.

Meet Appen - the company that's been quietly powering AI development since before ChatGPT was even a concept.

But here's where it gets interesting...

Facing intense competition from flashy AI startups, they didn't just update their logo - they completely reimagined their identity.

The transformation? From ""data annotation company"" to ""AI confidence partner.

""Our team at Laetro took on this massive challenge with a three-phase approach that would make even the most seasoned brand strategists sweat.

First, we uncovered a golden insight: Appen's real strength wasn't just in data annotation - it was in making AI trustworthy through human expertise. 

While other companies were racing to build the fastest AI, Appen was focused on building the most reliable AI.

This became our north star for the entire rebrand. 

We developed a visual identity that screams ""premium tech"" while maintaining the gravitas of a company that's been in the game for a quarter of a century.

The centerpiece? A striking 'A' monogram that captures both their heritage and their future vision. 

We backed it with a sophisticated black and white palette, punctuated with confident blue accents that stand out in a sea of tech-brand sameness.

The results? A brand that finally matches Appen's actual market position - not just as a service provider but as a crucial player in the future of responsible AI.

Major kudos to our dream team - Michael Lin, Ken Frederick, Sam Frentzel-Beyme, and James Hart for pushing the boundaries of a B2B tech brand.

And to Fab Dolan at Appen - thanks for trusting us with your company's future.

When I sat down with VCs focused on AI, their amazement matched mine. They were impressed that we’ve built our own AI with our own team, rather than relying solely on tools like OpenAI or Google APIs. In a space where 90% of AI startups use pre-existing platforms, this distinction stood out.

There’s nothing wrong with applying AI to create value—many startups do it brilliantly—but it’s clear we’re talking about two very different skill sets:
- Applying AI: Innovating through existing tools.
- Building AI: Creating the models and systems that push boundaries.

Both approaches are vital, but they deserve separate recognition. As the AI field grows, perhaps it’s time to celebrate these unique contributions in their own compartments.

First, I tried Claude. Claude, lacking the capability of chain of thought reasoning, made a mistake that you can see below. Here it assumed that Mr. Brown is just lying about him being Mr. Brown. This is clearly not what the problem statement said..

However, both Deepseek and GPT-O1-Preview created scenarios and then eliminated the incorrect ones in a step-by-step manner. Openai's O1-preview got the answer in 18 ms whereas Deepseek took 22 seconds. So, it is still lagging behind the Openai's model, but the best part is Deepseek is open sourced (<URL> 

Biggest hurdle behind o1-preview's adoption was the latency and the cost, but, with an open sourced and not too slow of a model, I think we are going to see a lot of opportunities for business tasks that need sequential reasoning. Personally, I think that such a model will be the best orchestrator for an multi-agent LLM systems and such approaches can make agentic AI adoption much more feasible.

𝐓𝐋;𝐃𝐑: I reimplemented the Swarm concept using #haystack, but made it work with both open and proprietary models 💫


Some time ago OpenAI published Swarm: an educational framework for building multi-agent systems.

Their approach focuses on two main concepts:
・ 𝐑𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬: Each agent follows specific 📜 instructions and uses 🛠️ tools to execute them.
・ 𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐟𝐟𝐬 🤝: Agents can transfer control to one another using tool/function calling.


When I first read these ideas, I thought: 𝘴𝘪𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘦 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘱𝘰𝘸𝘦𝘳𝘧𝘶𝘭! And they pair well with the recent unified tool support in Haystack.

🧑‍💻 So, I decided to re-implement these concepts using #haystack, and in just a few lines of code, I had a working prototype.

🆒 Bonus feature: this implementation isn't tied to a single model provider - different agents can be powered by different models! 

I replicated the ACME customer service example from the original article, with 3 Agents:
🐝 Triage Agent - Llama 3.2 running on Ollama
🐝 Sales Agent - Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet
🐝 Issues and Repairs Agent - OpenAI GPT-4o mini

Under the hood, it's a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) chatbot that combines GPT-4, vector search, and embeddings to make legislative research more intuitive. 

For those who might remember, last year Alex and I created a custom GPT named ""Parliamentarian GPT"" using OpenAI's custom GPT feature, connected to the GovInfo API. We've come a long way! Unlike our first iteration, there is no more slow exact-match searches - just ask questions in plain English and get relevant bills explained clearly.

Special thanks to Tyler Newman on helping me with this iteration's technical aspects, and seeing where we needed to go while breaking down complex concepts in accessible ways.

To my friends and colleagues, try it out! The best way to understand AI governance is to see where these systems succeed and fail firsthand.

Huge thanks to Elise Racine, and Luke Drago at BlueDot Impact for teaching me the broader implications of AI governance. And shout out to my cohort friends Maryama, Joe, and Aaron. 

If you are interested, I highly recommend BlueDot Impact's 12-week course (its free!).

As part of my journey in learning about large language models, I recently built a fun project to combine AI and football storytelling. Here’s what it does:
1️⃣ Interactive Chat Interface with Gradio
I used Gradio to create a sleek interface where users can input their favorite NFL game.
2️⃣ Dynamic Song Creation with OpenAI
The chatbot processes game details and generates a custom song summarizing the highlights—bringing football moments to life in a creative way.
3️⃣ Efficient Output and Presentation
Designed for quick responses, the chatbot demonstrates how large language models can process structured inputs and deliver engaging, user-friendly outputs.

Here’s the thing: AI is expensive. Training large models like GPT-4 doesn’t just cost millions—it burns through cash faster than a toddler in a toy store.

So, OpenAI has a solution: “Let’s build our own chips.”

It’s like owning the farm instead of buying the milk. Cheaper. Scalable. Genius.

Now, before you think, “Cool story, but I don’t run a chip factory,” 

ask yourself:

What are you spending too much on?

What could you own or control instead of outsourcing?

Where’s your scalable edge?


Businesses don’t need custom chips, but they do need custom strategies.

Maybe for you, it’s building an in-house team instead of relying on expensive freelancers. Or creating a proprietary process that competitors can’t copy.

The takeaway? Don’t just play the game. Find your edge. Build your “chip.”

The most interesting thing in AI Recruitment today...

OpenAI is gearing up to launch 'Operator' in January - an AI that can actually DO things for you, not just chat about them! 

But here's what's REALLY fascinating... 🤔

While everyone's focused on the ""book my flight"" features, I reckon this is the start of something much bigger:

1️⃣ This marks a seismic shift in how companies will need to hire AI talent. We're moving from 'model builders' to 'AI orchestrators' who can design systems that safely interact with real-world services.

2️⃣ The talent war is heating up! Anthropic, Microsoft, and Google are all racing to launch similar tools. I'm tracking a 47% increase in job postings mentioning AI Agents since September.

3️⃣ Most intriguingly, Sam Altman called this ""the next giant breakthrough"" - not model improvements. That's a MASSIVE hint about where the industry is heading.

🎯 My prediction? The companies that win won't be those with the smartest AI, but those with the safest, most reliable execution.

The real question: How will this reshape the AI talent landscape in 2025? 🤔

123,"This could be huge! Elon Musk's xAI is reportedly pushing to release a consumer-facing AI app as soon as next month to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT 😳

Last valued at $50 billion, xAI is late to a highly competitive party. OpenAI, Google (Gemini), and Anthropic (Claude) all have better-known chatbots that have been widely available for consumers and businesses since at least last year. 

But here comes the interesting part.

According to WSJ, when pitching to potential employees and investors, Musk’s team touts two advantages in the race to build the most powerful AI:

(1) Exclusive data from X and Tesla being used to train xAI’s models.

(2) An obsessive focus on building bigger data centers faster than his competitors. 

Remember that in just 122 days, xAI built and brought “Colossus” online, which is now the world’s most powerful AI training cluster (100k of NVIDIA's H100s).

If they execute the same with Grok, the AI chatbot market could be seriously challenged ultimately benefiting the consumers.

133,"RL and RLHF are not all you need-- why RL on GPUs is just another brick in the wall of diminishing returns OpenAI does not want you to notice...

Let us start with a basic truth. Reinforcement Learning and its sibling RLHF (RL with human feedback) may be required for any system claiming actual cognition and not merely contextual inference. Why? Because cognition isnt just about recognizing patterns or regurgitating outputs. It is about acting based on feedback, adapting dynamically, and learning in ways that reflect a genuine understanding of goals, consequences, and context. RL can help model this process. It can interact with an environment, take actions, get rewards or corrections, and improve. RLHF extends this with human judgement further shaping agentic behavior.

But here is the thing. This theoretical foundation runs headfirst into a harsh reality when implemented on GPUs, the compute backbone of GenAI. While GPUs are phenomenal for training large models and accelerating dense calculations like matrix multiplication or anything that fits SIMD, they are not built for cognition. They choke on the very things that make RL and RLHF essential. Dynamic feedback, statedependent decisions, and sequential reasoning are all GPU bottlenecks. 

RL needs systems that can interact continuously with an environment, update state based on rewards, and adjust policies in real time. RLHF adds human guidance, sparse but critical, to refine behavior. Finetuning with human input is supposed to make systems smarter, but it introduces even more computational challenges. Adaptability becomes key and GPUs simply are not made for it.

GPUs are optimized for parallel, predictable operations. They shine in training massive neural networks, where everything can be batched and computed simultaneously. But RL and RLHF need sequential decision making, where each step depends on the one before it. That dependency breaks the parallel efficiency of GPUs. Feedback is NOT predictable. Sparse updates midcomputation bring everything to a halt. Dynamic logic creates thread divergence (GPU threads splitting into different paths) and memory overhead increases with every state update.

This is why even the simplest RL like implementations in systems like the OpenAI o1 model suffer from latency. Every time you interact with it, the lag isnt just the model processing your input. It is the GPU hamsters getting tired under the weight of a workflow it was never built for.

OpenAI and others have hit this wall too. Scaling up on GPUs wont fix RL limitations. It is inefficient, expensive, and energy intensive, delivering only marginal gains or diminishing returns. 

Cognition demands real time adaptability, sequential reasoning, and dynamic feedback. GPUs, for all their power, were not designed for this. GenAI today is all about expensive brute force, not authentic intelligence. 

It is not just a wall but a dead end.

We had a chat about how performance management is done at Wolt and Miro, the role of continuous feedback, and the importance of great leadership.

I was really impressed to hear how boldly companies like Miro and Wolt are going about this, and to hear about AI’s potential from the experts like Laura / OpenAI.

Find the full discussion on video in comments. Would love to hear comments and discuss the topics.

4 key takeaways:

360 reviews and performance rounds suck. The tooling built around the traditional perf processes serve employee evaluation, budgeting, and the organization’s point of view on performance, but don’t help individuals to develop their abilities.

Great leadership cannot be automated. I think Ewa put it well: leadership can only be learned through a lot of practice, and by honing your judgement. Great performance is not only improved by process, but by maintaining a culture that makes your organization great.

1-1 meetings are a key to coaching people, but leaders lack the time to prepare for them. Like Niilo said: no leader has the luxury to spend most of their time thinking about people's performance. You have to be smart with the time you have for it, and performance management has to be integrated into your existing workflow. AI can help here 🤖

141,"Last month, I wrote an article, working with Jalaj Jain and his expertise in legal aspects of things, and posted it up to Centre for AI Leadership (C4AIL)'s Intelligence Explorer through our Opinion section. Literally 1 week later, Open Source Initiative (OSI) came out and openly shared that open-sourced LLMs has a proper definition, and there is some potential abuse of the term by companies who claim their LLMs as ""open-source"".

With that, we answer the question: is Llama 3.2 truly open-source? While Meta claims it is, the reality is more nuanced. Unlike traditional open-source software that uses standard licenses like MIT or Apache 2.0, Llama 3.2 operates under a custom Community License Agreement (CLA). This CLA includes restrictions on commercial use and sublicensing, which does not align with conventional open-source definitions.

Interestingly, Llama 3.2 doesn't fully comply with the Open Source Initiative's draft Open Source AI Definition. However, it's important to note that compared to other leading AI models from companies like OpenAI and Google, Llama 3.2 offers significantly more openness and flexibility. This approach seems to mirror Google's Android strategy: sacrificing immediate licensing revenue to build a dominant ecosystem.

Meta's strategy with Llama 3.2 represents a calculated move to challenge closed-source competitors and potentially reshape the AI landscape. While it may not meet the strictest definitions of open-source, it's undeniably a step towards greater accessibility in AI. The question remains: Is this a positive direction for AI development, or does it fall short of true open-source principles? What are your thoughts on Meta's approach?

149,"Quote: ""For a short time on Tuesday, a group of pissed-off artists shared a tool that allowed anyone to use OpenAI’s officially unreleased Sora AI model, which takes text prompts and turns them into videos. In an open letter titled “Dear Corporate AI Overlords,” accompanied by illustrations of figures raiding their middle fingers, the artists wrote that they’d been offered early access to Sora to test the product and be creative partners. Instead, they believe OpenAI wanted to use hundreds of unpaid AI artists like them for the purpose of “art washing” an exploitative business model.
“Hundreds of artists provide unpaid labor through bug testing, feedback and experimental work for the program for a $150B valued company,” the group wrote on the AI model-hosting platform Hugging Face. “While hundreds contribute for free, a select few will be chosen through a competition to have their Sora-created films screened—offering minimal compensation which pales in comparison to the substantial PR and marketing value OpenAI receives.” The letter was authored by 16 artists who said they weren’t opposed to the use of AI as an artistic tool—in fact, many of them are early adopters of AI in their work—but they felt the need to protest against an early access program that appeared to be a public relations ploy rather than an opportunity to freely experiment with and critique the tool. Any videos they created using the tool had to be approved by OpenAI before being shared, they said.
“What we don’t agree with is how this artist program has been rolled out and how the tool is shaping up ahead of a possible public release,” the group wrote. “We are sharing this to the world in the hopes that OpenAI becomes more open, more artist-friendly and supports the arts beyond PR stunts.”"" Source: <URL>",3,3,0.5355238318443298
150,"OpenAI’s secret video model leaked—and it’s sparking a revolution 🤯

The internet went wild when an AI tool was free for 3 hours. 

OpenAI’s new video generation model, SORA, was leaked online by a group called Angry Artists.

 For three hours, the model was freely available on Hugging Face before OpenAI managed to take it down.

Here's the crazy part: this model was in early access for select creators and artists, but the leaker posted it publicly with a bold message. 

Their letter, titled “Artists are not your unpaid R&D,” slammed OpenAI for putting AI tools behind paywalls instead of making them open for everyone.

⇨ The Leak:

• Angry Artists leaked OpenAI’s SORA model, making it free for three hours.

• They criticized OpenAI for restricting access to powerful tools.

• The letter attached to the leak argued for open access to AI technology.

⇨ The Debate:

• The leak sparked a huge debate about AI accessibility and ethics.

• Many argued that AI tools should be available to everyone, not just a select few.

• Others worried about the implications of unrestricted access to powerful AI.

⇨ The Impact:

• OpenAI shut down early access for all creators in response.

• The Hugging Face space hosting SORA was removed.

• The leak's impact on AI policy and access continues to be felt.

⇨  Leveraging the Leak for Future Change:

Understanding the leak encourages us to think about AI accessibility and ethics. It teaches us to:

⇨  Advocate for open access to AI tools, promoting innovation and creativity.

⇨  Engage in debates about the ethical implications of AI technology.

⇨  Recognize the power dynamics in technology access and work towards more equitable solutions.

→ By consciously navigating these issues, we can drive meaningful change in the AI community, foster innovation, and enhance ethical standards.

Whether you're a creator, developer, or enthusiast, remember: where you focus your energy can transform the impact of technology.

151,"🤖💸 When Microsoft & OpenAI Took ""It's Complicated"" to Billion-Dollar Levels 💸🤖

In 2019, Microsoft slid $13.75 billion over to OpenAI, whispering, ""You’re the future of AI, don’t let me down."" And, like any good friend, they struck a reasonable deal: Microsoft would get 75% of OpenAI's profits until they got their investment back—and even after, they’d still keep 49%. That’s commitment. 😆

But this bromance is starting to hit some, uh… “AI-dentity” issues. OpenAI, once a noble nonprofit, suddenly realized capitalism pays for cooler servers. 💸 Now they're trying to ""redefine"" themselves as a for-profit without making things awkward about that $14 billion sitting in a nonprofit. Enter Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to sort this out—aka the corporate marriage counselors. 📈👔

But hold up: control issues are brewing! Microsoft is OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider and slipped OpenAI tech into everything from GitHub Copilot to Azure. But lately, they’ve been side-eyeing each other. After a tough year for OpenAI, Microsoft spent $650M to hire talent from Inflection AI—maybe as a “backup AI BFF.” 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Meanwhile, OpenAI is flirting with Oracle for some cloud freedom. ☁️

Then there’s the AGI clause. If OpenAI invents AGI (the robot version of a human), Microsoft…loses access. Talk about awkward! What’s AGI? Nobody really knows, which makes it the world’s priciest mystery box. 🎁

So, here we are—Microsoft and OpenAI still smiling for the cameras, but secretly ready for solo careers. Welcome to the world’s weirdest tech ""situationship.""

Canada's largest news organization today filed a lawsuit against the American artificial intelligence (AI) company OpenAI, accusing OpenAI of using their articles to help train the AI ​​chatbot ChatGPT without permission.

Agence France-Presse reported that according to the statement, media including The Globe and Mail and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) accused OpenAI of copyright infringement, ""scooping large amounts of content"" and profiting from the use of this content.

This behavior was done without consent or payment to news organizations. These news organizations claimed that these articles were illegally scraped and used to train the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, and claimed 20,000 Canadian dollars (approximately) for each article. NT$472,000), the total compensation may reach billions of dollars.

The Canadian federation of news organizations said: ""Journalism is in the public interest and OpenAI's use of other companies' news for its own commercial interests is not. It is illegal.""

In response to the lawsuit, a spokesperson for OpenAI said that the OpenAI chatbot was trained using publicly available data ""in accordance with fair use and relevant international copyright principles, which is both fair to creators and supports innovation.""

The spokesperson added that OpenAI also cooperates with news publishers.

Oracle seals partnerships with Azure and AWS. For what exactly?

Let's take a closer look.

🔴 Oracle Cloud  x Amazon Web Services (AWS)  🟠
Oracle is preparing its entry into the cloud leader's platform by making its databases and Exadata directly accessible in AWS. Note that the service will be more widely deployed in 2025.

The promises? Optimized connection between Oracle databases and AWS applications, simplified billing via AWS Marketplace, and most importantly, native integration with AWS analytics and AI services, notably Bedrock. No more juggling between different platforms!

On the other side.

🔴 ORACLE x Microsoft Azure  🔵
The partnership with Microsoft is already well-established. Oracle database services run directly in Azure datacenters, offering minimal latency and deep integration with Microsoft services, notably Azure OpenAI.

💡What's the common thread between these two alliances?

A desire to simplify business operations with unified support and a seamless experience. Oracle recognizes that multicloud has become the norm and is adapting to customer needs.

❤️ The feedback would be positive

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has set the AI world buzzing with his latest statement: artificial general intelligence (AGI) might just be around the corner, with a potential breakthrough in 2025. 🤯

In a recent interview with YC founder Gary Tan, Altman revealed that the path to AGI is “basically clear” and hinges on engineering efforts rather than scientific breakthroughs. This confidence is striking, particularly given reports of slower progress across the industry.

*Key updates*:
Orion Model: The rumored ‘Orion’ model reportedly shows a smaller improvement over GPT-4, particularly in coding tasks — sparking mixed reactions.
Foundations Team: OpenAI has created a dedicated team to tackle fundamental challenges, including the scarcity of high-quality training data.
o1 Reasoning Model: Backed by OpenAI researchers Noam Brown and Clive Chan, this new model promises new scaling capabilities, potentially bypassing previous limitations.

It’s a fascinating time in AI, with these developments hinting that engineering innovation might help break through scaling barriers and accelerate progress towards AGI. 

Altman’s vision for 2025 could redefine the pace and scale of advancements we see in artificial intelligence.

163,"OpenAI search is here – is it over for Google?

OpenAI just released its latest feature: integrating web search directly into ChatGPT for real-time, AI-powered results. 

With OpenAI’s fine-tuned GPT-4o model behind it, users can now access up-to-date information seamlessly across iOS, Android, and desktop platforms.

Why does this matter?

	1.	No Ads: OpenAI’s search engine is ad-free (for now), unlike Google’s ad-cluttered search results.
	2.	Fewer Hallucinations: Real-time data helps improve factual accuracy.
	3.	Partnerships: OpenAI has teamed up with media giants to ensure responsible content usage, steering clear of copyright conflicts.

This move is a big move from OpenAi. However, AI-powered search is significantly more costly than traditional search, so it’ll be interesting to see how they plan to cover these expenses for free users.”

In December 2021, I saw a post on Reddit about a new method to generate an image from a text and  I was mind-blown. The post was about machine learning algorithms, VQGAN and CLIP. The first was an algorithm to generate images and the second ( created by OpenAI in 2021) excelled in matching text and images. 
Some Reddit users were exploring how they could use VQGAN and CLIP together to create images from text (""GAN Art""), and a researcher created a Google Colab notebook that everybody could use to test VQGAN+CLIP. 

If I remember well, it took about 45 minutes to generate the below image, with as input ""CRM"" (Thanks Salesforce). It also output a video to show you the evolution of the generated image, which was pretty cool.

It’s happening faster than I expected.

In just a few weeks, Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google have made big strides toward building AI agents that can actually use computers like humans do.

Here’s the latest:

- Anthropic’s API (Live): Claude can now operate software, though still learning.

- OpenAI’s Operator (Rumored): A browser-operating agent tackling real-world tasks like booking travel.

- ChatGPT macOS Integration (Beta): Interacts with desktop apps like Xcode.

- Google’s ‘Project Jarvis’ (Rumored): Uses screenshots to navigate websites and complete tasks.

Why this matters: Until now, AI has been smart but stuck behind the glass—giving advice but unable to act. 

That’s about to change. If a human can do it on a computer, AI agents will soon be able to do it too.

- Start thinking about specialized agents—focused tools that excel at specific tasks.

- Rethink your product roadmap:

178,"🤖 The Battle for AI’s Future: Elon Musk vs. OpenAI 🔥

The world of AI is heating up with Elon Musk making bold moves on two fronts. First, he’s challenging OpenAI’s shift to a for-profit model, arguing it undermines the nonprofit values it was built on. Musk believes this transition could prioritize profits over ethical AI development, raising critical questions about the balance between innovation and accountability.

At the same time, Musk’s Grok is raising debates with its unfiltered and bold responses, drawing comparisons to ChatGPT. The rivalry highlights different approaches- one emphasizing “truthful” answers, the other offering nuanced versatility.

As AI evolves, these developments remind us that its future depends on a balance between purpose, transparency, and innovation.

181,"Getting back to the AI-related highlights from the recent Infoshare conference. Both on the stage and informally, people talk about the trends that are fully aligned with what we've noticed at other events in the US and Germany earlier this year.

Let's go.

🌟Agnieszka Niezgoda, PhD, PhD on Agent-based approaches in LLM solutions. 

💡 If you have a large context, the inquiry will cost you more. Cache layer makes it cheaper and faster;
💡 The speech covered RAG technique, LangGraph, LangChain, Autogen (with a human in the loop) frameworks;
💡 Large Action Models (LAMs) will emerge further.

🌟Magdalena Ostoja-Chyżyńska shared the experience of her design studio with AI. 

💡 AI tools in their current state don't replace designers. Consider AI as your Co-Creator, Co-Artist if you wish. It helps with the early stages of the process;
💡 Jr. Designers rapidly progress to the Mid. level now thanks to AI. Middle to Senior is more tricky though;
💡 Tools: Midjourney, Figma AI, Exactly AI (outcome close to your prompt/style), Photoshop, Stable Diffusion, OpenArt AI, Claude AI, Slides AI, Plus AI, OpenAI o2 model. 

🌟Inga Apiecionek shared 7 lessons on AI adoption at Ringier Axel Springer Polska.

💡 AI strategy cannot exist in a vacuum. Start with your ""why?"". Align it with your company strategy. Discovery phase is a must;
💡Use the combination of metrics while assessing AI implementation;
💡 Example. Microsoft says GitHub Copilot helps to develop new code 55% faster. If we assume that a software dev spends 10% of their time on coding on average (we can argue here regarding the %). Multiplying 55% by 10% gives us only 5.5% of real acceleration;
💡 Garbage in > Garbage out. High-quality training data is a must. Even with the best AI models.

🌟Zuza Kwiatkowska spoke about deepfakes and how to fight them. 

💡 A 10-sec recording of your voice is enough to generate an audio deepfake for disinformation or phishing;
💡 Longer recordings enable deepfake generation on the fly;
💡Educate your teams, children, and parents, on the latest technology and its threats. 

🌟Piotr Mieczkowski on cybersecurity from the perspective of people in Poland. 
Insightful statistics. Kids security topic resonated the most with me as the father of two. 

🌟Marcin Banaszkiewicz on authenticity crisis on LinkedIn. 

💡LinkedIn is a Human-to-Human platform;
💡People don’t buy products and services on LN. Nobody cares about the content aiming at selling something or promoting a company. And the majority of LN content falls exactly in that category;
💡People seek people who can give them value;
💡People tend to skip AI-generated texts;
💡Construct your post like a practicing hands-on surgeon, rather than like a university professor;
💡So choose what you want: A. have a beautiful and correct text with AI and lose your audience, or B. spend more time and stay authentic and not ideal. 

I choose the B option. 

That’s probably the reason you have read this post till the end ;)

183,"T R U M P  x  A I  C Z A R  - President-elect Trump is considering naming an AI czar in the White House to coordinate federal policy and governmental use of the emerging technology, Trump transition sources told Axios.

Why it matters: Elon Musk won't be the AI czar, but is expected to be intimately involved in shaping the future of the debate and use cases, the sources said.

Behind the scenes: Told the role is likely but not certain.

Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy — who are leading Trump's new outside-government group, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — will have significant input into who gets the role.

Musk — who owns a leading AI company, xAI — has feuded publicly with rival CEOs, including OpenAI's Sam Altman and Google's Sundar Pichai. Rivals worry Musk could leverage his Trump relationship to favor his companies.

The big picture: Trump, partly in response to the enlarged coalition that fueled his victory, plans to be super attentive to emerging technologies.

💡 How did I measure this?
The SCC Report evaluates code performance, efficiency, and estimated project value. Using this guide, I discovered that my work this month achieved:
- 96.8x performance ratio: What would normally take 8 years of development was done in 1 month. (I have 3 days to hit the 100X milestone!)
- $1M+ equivalent value: That’s what companies typically pay for similar software development. (My rates are a little lower)

Amazon is investing another $4 billion in Anthropic – double its current stake – as it seeks a bestie in the AI race.

The two firms were already close: Anthropic uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its essential cloud provider and AI model training partner. That’s helping it develop Claude, the humanlike AI assistant that competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. And now, the startup says AWS will become its primary cloud provider and provide it with the chips it needs to train future models. So if Amazon’s investment in Anthropic is repaid through chip sales, that's part of the plan: it's trying to get developers to switch away from Nvidia's industry-leading chips.

Nvidia is the undisputed market champ when it comes to the advanced chips that are needed to run generative AI. And its biggest customers are AWS, Microsoft, and Alphabet. But these Big Tech companies hate to pay big bucks for someone else’s technology when they can build stuff in-house. That’s why the three are each working to develop their own chips. But don’t go shedding any tears for Nvidia: the behemoth’s advanced semiconductors are still well ahead of everyone.

US antitrust regulators are casting an eye over the AI industry – and that includes Microsoft, OpenAI, Amazon, Anthropic, and Alphabet. The feds are worried that these goliaths might just be too dominant. In fact, only last week, the Department of Justice recommended that Google be forced to sell off its search business. Whether that happens is still unclear, but it shows the level of scrutiny that the giants of tech might soon be under.

But what does it mean, and who decides this, especially when the vast majority of us around the world are consumers and users rather than creators of the underlying technologies and models. 

While regulation is one approach that many are rightfully exploring and pursuing at the national and even international levels, governance protections built into the corporate constituent document level has for some time intrigued many seeking to balance people, profit and planet to better align shareholders integral to capital raising and the other crucial stakeholders impacted by corporate activity. 

So many of the new and increasingly influential #GenAI maker companies have adopted novel corporate governance structures, from Anthopic's Long Term Benefit Trust structure, to Elon Musk's xAI's Nevada Benefit Corporation. OpenAI famously started as a tax-exempt Delaware incorporated non-profit company and evolved into ""capped profit"" structure in 2019 that opened the door for critical investment from VCs and Microsoft that allowed it to allow the world to access ChatGPT. Reuters has reported that after closing its US$6.6 billion fundraising valuing it at US$157 billion in October, Open AI is now seeking to be reorganised into a Delaware public benefit corporation. 

PBCs have already started to go public in the US, beginning with the IPO of Laureate Education in 2017 that has been followed by companies such as insurancetech Lemonade and pasture-raised egg producer Vital Farms in 2020 and eyewear maker Warby Parker in 2021. 

Pioneer Post recently published a provocative article on ""Is OpenAI impact washing by becoming a public benefit corporation?"" and I was glad to be invited to share my thoughts alongside Melanie Rieback, Luke Fletcher James Gauci Rhodri Davies (see link in comments). While the reported high burn rate of OpenAI explains the need for capital, VCs seek exits, and there are precedents for PBC IPOs. And although the Delaware PBC legislation allows shareholders of 2% of the PBC's outstanding shares to enforce the balancing requirement, that would be a high bar indeed for most activist shareholders and NGOs of a US$150+B company!

↳ OpenAI’s rumored “Orion” model shows only minor improvements over GPT-4, especially in complex coding. This has sparked debate on whether AGI is as close as Altman suggests.

3️⃣ New “Foundations Team” on Core Challenges
↳ OpenAI has created a team focused on critical issues, like the shortage of high-quality training data — something essential for AGI scaling.

4️⃣ O1 Model’s Scaling Potential
↳ Researchers Noam Brown and Clive Chan believe the new o1 reasoning model might break current scaling limits, potentially accelerating progress toward AGI.

💡 Why It Matters
If Altman’s prediction is accurate, OpenAI could leap from its current AGI scale (level 2 of 5) to the ultimate level 5. Such a breakthrough would mark a transformative shift for the entire AI industry.

Brainstorming and summarizing top the Year 2 usage charts among the 33% of employees who say they're using AI in their work.

The other 67% indicates a huge unrealized opportunity for transformation. While company security policies continue to push AI usage underground, the spread of shared learning and productivity gains will remain stunted. I wish we can find a way to mediate this conflict with essential security practices.

My hot takes for Year 3 of AI:

📈 Major gains in business using AI to interact with customers on a first-line basis. Consumer trust is growing, and AI's ability to handle more complex tasks is accelerating. Just ask Boardy.

🤖 Enterprise SaaS will be eroded by bootstrapped AI founders creating no-code single-feature low-cost platforms for users who don't need full Enterprise packages.

212,"📢 Canadian News Media Takes Legal Action Against OpenAI Over Copyright Breaches

A coalition of five Canadian media giants, which includes Torstar, Postmedia, and CBC/Radio-Canada, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI for allegedly using their copyrighted content for commercial purposes through its AI systems without any permission or compensation. The move underlines growing tensions between traditional media and generative AI technologies. 

The lawsuit alleged that OpenAI ""misappropriated"" news content to feed its AI models-a red flag raised for the sensitive balance between innovation and rights of intellectual property.  OpenAI argues its side by citing reliance on publicly available data, adherence to ""fair use"" principles, and opt-out options for publishers.  The lawsuit is part of a wave of global actions by creators and copyright holders against AI firms over regulatory and ethical challenges in the industry.

As AI technology advances, finding a fair framework that supports innovation while respecting creators' rights is more urgent than ever.

215,"Elon Musk is asking a federal court to stop OpenAI from converting into a fully for-profit business.
Attorneys representing Musk, his AI startup xAI, and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis filed for a preliminary injunction against OpenAI on Friday. The injunction would also stop OpenAI from allegedly requiring its investors to refrain from funding competitors, including xAI and others.

The latest court filings represent an escalation in the legal feud between Musk, OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman, as well as other long-involved parties and backers including tech investor Reid Hoffman and Microsoft.
Musk had originally sued OpenAI in March 2024 in a San Francisco state court, before withdrawing that complaint and refiling several months later in federal court. Attorneys for Musk in the federal suit, led by Marc Toberoff in Los Angeles, argued in their complaint that OpenAI has violated federal racketeering, or RICO, laws.
In mid-November, they expanded their complaint to include allegations that Microsoft and OpenAI had violated antitrust laws when the Chat GPT-maker allegedly asked investors to agree to not invest in rival companies, including Musk’s newest startup, xAI.
Microsoft declined to comment.
 In their motion for preliminary injunction, attorneys for Musk argue that OpenAI should be prohibited from “benefitting from wrongfully obtained competitively sensitive information or coordination via the Microsoft-OpenAI board interlocks.”


“Elon’s fourth attempt, which again recycles the same baseless complaints, continues to be utterly without merit,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement.
OpenAI has emerged as one of the biggest startups in recent years, with ChatGPT becoming a major hit that has helped usher massive corporate enthusiasm over AI and related large language models.
Since Musk announced xAI’s debut in July 2023, his newer AI business has released its Grok chatbot and is raising up to $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation, in part to buy 100,000 Nvidia chips, CNBC reported earlier this month.
“Microsoft and OpenAI now seek to cement this dominance by cutting off competitors’ access to investment capital (a group boycott), while continuing to benefit from years’ worth of shared competitively sensitive information during generative AI’s formative years,” the lawyers wrote in the filing.
The attorneys wrote that the terms OpenAI asked investors to agree to amounted to a “group boycott” that “blocks xAI’s access to essential investment capital.”
The lawyers later added that OpenAI “cannot lumber about the marketplace as a Frankenstein, stitched together from whichever corporate forms serve the pecuniary interests of Microsoft.”
In July, Microsoft gave up its observer seat on OpenAI’s board, although CNBC reported that the Federal Trade Commission would continue to monitor the influence of two companies over the AI industry",2,3,0.5349467992782593

221,"A lazy Sunday afternoon, reading some papers. Then I come across a thought-provoking article by the Alibab MarcoPolo Team on ways to improve ""reasoning"" capabilities (you know I am not too fond using that word for the extended inferencing GenAI models do to imitate human reasoning, but alas). Using the Marco-01 model, finetuning Qwen-7B (Huggingface, if you want to try), showing 32B params, they show impressive improvements on various reasoning tasks. You might think that this is what we hear regularly (and we do), so why is this something one posts about? 

My picks: 
a) it is a much smaller model then the competition (lower footprint, smaller hardware needs, etc)
b) it's an open-source model (Apache 2.0 license), which will start to become an argument in a world of proprietary models
c) whereas OpenAI o1 series are using inference-time scaling, QwQ 

Compare it with the OpenAI model o1, using a technique called inference-time scaling to improve its reasoning abilities. This allows it to generate more responses and review them, leading to better performance on tasks that require complex thinking. o1 has shown strong results in standard tasks with known or expected outcomes like math, physics, and coding. The QwQ model is trained on OpenAI O1 CoT, but also the Marco-01 CoT and a very interesting 3rd approach based upon Monte Carlo method (1940s) ""which uses random sampling for deterministic problems which are difficult or impossible to solve using other approaches"" (quote Wikipedia), a development called Monte Carlo Tree Search. And why would that be relevant? Just because it is the algorithm that made AlphaGo beat the worldchampion in Go. MTCS excels in finding moves in ""open search"" spaces, i.e. problems that are not having a clear expected outcome. It helps building reasoning paths in those cases where not ""all is known"", as in most real-world scenarios. 
That's why it caught my interest, as this is another show case of how combining previous AI developments and methods improves the current State of the Art. 

d) it introduces a (still rather naïve) reflection mechanism, that might be developed into something more efficient and powerful. It basically halts the reasoning at critical points and asks for possible retraces (like one could do with the good old depth-first searches in declarative languages such as Prolog)

This latter has shown its value in multi-agent scenarios (featuring a ""critique"" agent. And to some sense such a principle ´is behind GAN too (a Generator-agent and a Discriminator-agent). 

As the authors clearly state: it's work in progress. But the results they show are promising, and the fact that this could improve ""open-ended"" reasoning tasks as in strategy development, process-(re)design and things like product development.

Elon Musk is making another move in AI. 

 xAI is  launching a standalone consumer app for its chatbot, Grok. This won’t be just another chatbot in a crowded market. Dig deeper, and you see that Musk is playing a different game, as he always does. 

Grok is positioned to be more than a tool, it’s an experience. Grok is different in many ways.  With access to real-time data from X , Grok offers up-to-date responses grounded in current events and trends. Nothing gets more ‘current’ than people tweeting in real time. ChatGPT does not have access to this. 

Additionally, Grok’s got a personality….or two, to be precise!  Users can toggle between a witty “Fun Mode” or a more straight-laced “Regular Mode,” making interactions feel fresh and personalized.

But then it  goes beyond personality. 

It’s about two different philosophies. Musk’s Grok aims to be politically neutral, edgy, and bold, a sharp contrast to OpenAI’s safer, regular,  more universal approach.

And then there’s the bigger picture. xAI aims to leveraging Musk’s broader ecosystem, from X to Star Link, to create synergies that OpenAI can’t easily replicate. 

The upcoming app might just be the first step in turning Grok into an AI that feels deeply integrated into users’ daily lives.

While Grok’s success will depend on whether Musk can translate his bold idea into meaningful value for users, the battel of ideologies and strategies could shape how we begin to accept AI in its different forms and interact with it. On the technical front, xAI does better v/s GPT 3.5 but not GPT 4.

These are still early days. A lot has to unfold.

 What do you think? Are you excited about he Grok consumer app? Does Grok have what it takes to challenge ChatGPT?

Collaborating alongside my incredible team—Atreya Ghosh, Srinitya Chirravuri, and Vivian Nguyen— and our phenomenal project manager Shreya Ramani, we designed and developed TidyTerms, a website and a chrome extension that transforms how users interact with complex terms and conditions documents.

What is TidyTerms?
TidyTerms simplifies lengthy and confusing legal documents, providing concise and actionable summaries powered by OpenAI’s GPT technology. It empowers users to make informed decisions by quickly understanding key highlights, such as:

🛡️ Privacy policies and data sharing practices
❌ Cancellation terms and hidden fees
🔍 Searchable clauses

This tool was crafted to protect consumer rights by making legal language accessible and easy to understand.

As part of the backend team alongside Atreya, I:
- Established and integrated robust user authentication using Auth0.
- Optimized database management with MongoDB for seamless data control.
- Integrated the frontend and backend to power our key features like Document Scanning and AI-driven Highlights Extraction.

Challenges We Overcame:
One major challenge was integrating OpenAI and Auth0 within the constraints of a Chrome extension. Initially, we aimed to run the entire application within the extension. However, due to differing environments and library limitations, we pivoted to include a website, providing the flexibility needed to deliver a complete user experience.

🌟 Presentation Night Highlights
Presenting TidyTerms during ACM Projects Presentation Night was the perfect showcase of our team's dedication, creativity, and teamwork. 🎉 A special shoutout to our industry mentor, Royce Mathews from Dell Technologies for his unwavering support and guidance and for being our biggest cheerleader. 🙌
A huge thank you to ACM UTD and the incredible ACM Projects co-directors, Karina Batra and Syed Mohammad Abis Naqvi for curating this transformative experience. This opportunity not only helped me develop industry-level skills but also fostered lifelong friendships. And of course thank you to our Project Manager Shreya Ramani for her guidance, encouragement, and incredible leadership throughout this journey!

Considering the level of discussion I see online these days + TikTok videos, I'd say AI is way beyond AGI at this point. 

The naysayers might be right for saying what we do see these days isn't AI per definitionem, but with the PISA scores of 2022 being lower than in 2018, where scores dropped by 16.6, 23 and 8.3 in math, reading and science, respectively, from 2003-2022. The projected scores of 2025 won't make you smile either, at 16.9, 21.1 and 7, respectively.  

If that's the case, I'd then gladly say AI is the pinnacle of human evolution to date.

250,"Do not trust embeddings unquestioningly for the similarity of short strings.

Lately, I have talked to many technical folks from job boards introducing embeddings into their search/match functionality.

Although this new technology has some significant use cases, you should not trust it unquestioningly.

While working on a simple matching problem, I encountered a fascinating phenomenon: seemingly identical text strings can yield surprisingly different semantic representations. Let me share a practical example from recent experimentation.

Consider these two developer role titles:
.net developer
 .NET Developer

When processed through a modern embedding model, these strings achieved a cosine similarity of only 0.68, which reveals how AI processes text differently than humans.

Let me explain how we measure text similarity in AI. Cosine similarity is our go-to metric in natural language processing. It measures the angle between two vectors in a high-dimensional space.

An embedding model like the OpenAI text-embedding-3-small processes text and converts each phrase into a vector (essentially a list of numbers) in this space. The closer these vectors align, the more similar the meanings. A score of 1.0 means perfect alignment, while 0 indicates a complete difference.

This mathematical approach helps us quantify semantic relationships that might not be obvious to the human eye. In our "".net developer"" example, that 0.68 score tells us the vectors point in roughly the same direction but with notable divergence, reflecting the semantic nuances we discussed above.

So what is happening here? These strings are semantically the same, right? Let’s do a technical deep dive:

1. Token-Level Processing: Modern language models employ subword tokenization, where capitalization significantly impacts token decomposition. This isn't merely about case sensitivity but fundamental representation in the model's vocabulary space.

2. Contextual Embedding Dynamics:
Lowercase ""net"" typically generates embeddings associated with broader network concepts or fish nets. 
"".NET"" produces specialized embeddings closely aligned with Microsoft's development ecosystem
Position-sensitive transformers process capitalized terms differently based on learned patterns from training data

In the case of embeddings, the longer the text you provide, the better the similarity score you can trust. 

Have a look at the same example, but add two more words that improve the context. Suddenly, the score jumps to 0.73.
 
This understanding is crucial for building robust NLP systems. It has practical industry implications for embeddings in search and matches if you aim to develop accurate content-matching systems.

These nuances become increasingly vital as we develop enterprise solutions leveraging generative AI. They impact everything from search relevance to semantic matching in production systems.

╰┈➤ The news media companies are legally claiming for a declaration that the OpenAI is liable for:

1️⃣ ""Infringing, authorizing, and/or inducing the infringement of the News Media Companies’ copyright in the Owned Works (defined below), contrary to sections 3 and 27 of the Copyright Act, RSC 1985, c C-42 (“Copyright Act”);
2️⃣ Engaging in prohibited circumvention of technological protection measures that prescribed access to, and restricted copying of, the News Media Companies’ Works (defined below), contrary to, and within the meaning of, section 41 and 41.1 of the Copyright Act;
3️⃣ Breaching the Terms of Use (defined below) of the News Media Companies’ Websites (defined below); and
4️⃣ Unjustly enriching themselves at the expense of the News Media Companies."" 

╰┈➤ The media companies argue they employed technological protection on their websites, including exclusion protocols (e.g., robots.txt) and account and subscription-based restrictions. However, when OpenAI scraped their content for its for-profit activities, it circumvented the protective measures deployed.

╰┈➤  Regarding the infringement of the Terms of Use, they argue:

""(...) each of the Terms of Use expressly prohibit the use of the News Media Companies’ Websites and Works for any use other than personal, non-commercial uses. The Terms of Use also generally prohibit users from reproducing, distributing, broadcasting, making derivative works from, retransmitting, distributing, publishing, communicating, or otherwise making available any of the Works. Any uses not expressly permitted by the Terms of Use require the News Media Companies’ express consent—particularly commercial uses.

Since as early as 2015, OpenAI has breached and continues to breach the applicable Terms of Use for each of the Websites in various ways, including by accessing, scraping, and/or copying the Works for use as part of the Training Data to train its GPT models and/or as part of the RAG Data to augment its for-profit commercial products and services.""

╰┈➤ The Terms of Use breach argument, coupled with the infringement of the technological protective measures claim, might prove to be a successful legal ground for the news media companies to be successful in this lawsuit. Why? Because it diverges the focus of the dispute from potential fair use-based defenses or endless discussions about the technicalities of the LLM training process.

But the real news (that has NVIDIA's attention) is buried in the article:

I think Amazon is firmly in the “Buy” camp of build vs buy when it comes to generative AI. They have the most valuable set of consumer purchasing data in the world, so they definitely need to invest.

But instead of building their own huge frontier model (like Google / Meta / OpenAI), they’re investing in frontrunner Anthropic (maker of Claude).

In collaboration with Prateek Gupta, Drew Propson, Bryan Zhang, and Hunter Sims, I am excited to share our thinking at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, Cambridge Judge Business School and the World Economic Forum on how Agentic AI—LLMs with API-powered tool access—will go mainstream and revolutionise financial services going forward. 

<URL>

Agentic AI systems that perceive, reason, and act ever more autonomously are already emerging—and the pace of adoption is set to skyrocket. 📈 Some of the key players defining Agentic AI’s emergent capabilities include LangChain, Meta's Llama, Anthropic's Claude MCP, Microsoft's AutoGen, OpenAI's GPTs, CrewAI, LlamaIndex, NVidia's Nemo, Google Deepmind’s Gemini, Mistral to name but a few!

Here are a few things this means for financial services and beyond:

💡 Smarter Decision: Agentic AI will be able to analyse vast data sets in real time for better, faster financial insights. Think autonomous trading agents fine-tuning strategies on the fly! 
⚙️ Increased Efficiency: By automating complex workflows, institutions can save time and reduce costs, freeing up humans to focus on finding the right problems to solve rather than problem solving. 
🎯 Personalised Experiences: Agent-driven tailored services will source the right product or service for each of our needs and preferences. Gone will be the days of trawling the web for hours in search of the best deal. 
🌍 Financial Inclusion: Agentic AI could extend financial services to underserved communities, by reducing costs of service provision, personalised advice and financial product access. 
🚨 The Challenges: With great potential comes great responsibility—labour shifts, privacy concerns, and ethical AI governance will need careful navigation. 🧩⚖️

“Similarly, many organizations begin their AI journey by consuming pre-built models (such as those offered by OpenAI or Google).”

“However, as they develop more expertise and encounter the limitations of generic models, they often shift to fine-tuning or even training their own models.”

“The shift requires a heftier investment in infrastructure, tools, talent and security.”

“Executives should anticipate this trajectory and plan accordingly.”

“The working assumption should be that AI will become more pervasive and mission-critical over the next 2-5 years; accordingly, its deployment will require a different set of skills, infrastructure, and governance processes.”

Or was it a magic circle partner?

Was this lawyer endorsing OpenAI genAI for creating legal briefs worth $1000-$2000/ hour?

Are we there yet?

OpenAI must have some kind of usage data (possibly the largest set as they also partner with Microsoft) to consider legal & lawyers as one of their barometers of value and pricing 

This Bloomberg interview raises so many questions — 

Are we under-reporting our own usage and adoption of AI as the law industry while the the numbers at OpenAI tell them otherwise?

Are all the news snippets about hallucinations, not-fully-baked tech, etc just a percentage error that the media amplifies?

Are the polls, social media posts, surveys and news not depicting the real situation (when have our polls and surveys been wrong when it matters)? 

Are we hiding our usage because of some kind of perceived backlash (peers, clients, employees)?  

Is legal going to be one of the focus areas for OpenAI? What does that mean for legal tech as we know it?

296,"“The Salesforce CEO said he thinks the future of AI advancement lies in autonomous agents — not the large language models used to train bots like ChatGPT.” “I actually think we're hitting the upper limits of the LLMs right now.”

Over the last several years, he also said “we've all got drunk on the ChatGPT Kool-Aid, leading the average consumer to believe that AI is more powerful than it is and that LLMs are key to advancement in the technology. But there is a burgeoning use of artificial intelligence — autonomous agents, which can be deployed to conduct tasks independently, such as executing sales communications or marketing campaigns — that he says will be more significant than LLMs have been for companies trying to become more efficient and transform the world of work.”

Interesting argument. If one application doesn’t work, try another; might be good advice. But such an argument also reduces the credibility of AI. We’ve already seen the focus of AI change many times, from Watson AI in healthcare to self-driving cars, radiology, and then two years of generative AI. Now GenAI is over, and agents are the next big thing? Hmm. 

One reason for Benioff’s comments might be that “Salesforce offers prebuilt and customizable AI agents for clients seeking to automate customer service tasks.” Similarly, “OpenAI is closing in on a launch date for its own agents, which Bloomberg reported will be able to complete assigned tasks like writing code or booking travel.”

""We have incredible tools to augment our productivity, to augment our employees, to prove our margins, to prove our revenues, to make our companies fundamentally better, have higher fidelity relationships with our customers,"" Benioff said. ""But we are not at that moment that we've seen in these crazy movies — and maybe we will be one day, but that is not where we are today.""

Benioff uses science fiction to buttress his argument, not always a good ploy. He “said the general public has learned about the power of AI agents from movies like the 1984 film Terminator, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and about a cyborg assassin, and the 2002 hit ""Minority Report,"" about police preemptively arresting would-be criminals thanks to a program that detects crime before it occurs.” 

“In Minority Report, the precrime detection program is powered by psychics called ""precogs"" who have the precognitive ability to predict crime before it happens. However, the film is often referenced in conversations about artificial intelligence, as it raised questions about how advanced computer programs could be used to detect and prevent crime.”

Hmm… I don’t think that these examples will cite users, and might anger the public.

The promise of Operator as an Agentic gadget driving and driven by GPT is a wonderful marketing delusion designed to get the next round of funding that will be required mid-year, or, I suspect, earlier if they get access to adequate compute resources, which they are complaining about as not being adequate now.

Using this approach (Operator agents) will drive their compute requirements through the roof if it catches on because it will require the reasoning system GPT-o1 which we already know increases compute requirements by one or two orders of magnitude. I suspect this is why Operator will be released on a limited basis, until the data centres can be built and scaled up to meet the compute load and Nvidia can get Blackwell out there.",3,3,0.5338581204414368

299,"About a year ago, I started working on the Billion-Dollar LLM Hallucination Problem. One of the keys to solving the problem is to give the LLM a way to remember its training documents, so that it can produce the most relevant tokens for the specific context, not just the most likely tokens across all contexts. The technology for doing this is Neocortix Deep Attribution Networks, which provide the necessary function of Source Attribution in LLMs. Deep Attribution Networks can be used to cite sources from the training dataset, to detect hallucinations, and, when properly integrated into the LLM, to mitigate hallucinations.

I have found that something great happens when I build a new technology to solve a tough problem: it ends up being useful to solve other problems.  Sometimes those other problems can be just as important, urgent, or economically significant as the original problem I started with.

In September 2024, at Stanford, Gary Marcus was asked about how content creators could be compensated for their contributions to the training dataset of an LLM.  Gary's answer: ""I can start with what would be perfect, but cannot be done, for now.  What would be perfect is, every time an answer is produced, you do what we would call Source Attribution.   You say, where did this answer come from?  If it's 3% from here, and 5% from there, then you just compensate people accordingly.  The problem is, we don't actually know how to do that.  LLMs are black boxes.  We don't know where the answers come from.  That's a huge technical problem.  It's a reason to press for better technology.""

Beautiful.  Gary was summarizing the state of the art prior to Neocortix invention of Deep Attribution Networks and their application into the LLMs.  A few days after his talk at Stanford, I reached out to Gary and told him about the Deep Attribution Network technology I had invented in early 2024, and its relevance to the problem of Proportional Royalty Allocation, and showed him the demo of it working on the Neocortix website (link in first comment). After answering Gary's thorough diligence questions, I invited Gary to join the Neocortix Technology Advisory Board, and a few days later Gary accepted the invitation.

There are currently 35 copyright lawsuits in progress against large AI companies, including OpenAI, Google, Nvidia, Microsoft, Perplexity, etc.  I suspect that many of the defendants will use the argument that ""LLMs are black boxes, we don't know where the answers come from, and there is no technology in the world that can do Source Attribution or Proportional Royalty Allocation.""

Ahem. Well, yes there is. There are working demonstrations on the Neocortix website, with 5 patent applications filed. So, I am wondering how those lawsuits would be affected if the plaintiffs and the judges in those 35 pending lawsuits were informed about the existence of a working technology that can do it? And would the defendants want to get ahead of that?

300,"In early 2023, I met Sam Altman.

He said, “AI will change the economy this year.”

Looking back, generative AI adoption has been extraordinary. Yet, we’re still in the early adopter stage.

To understand this journey, I revisited Geoffrey Moore’s Crossing the Chasm, a must-read for understanding how technologies move from niche to mainstream markets.

Moore defines five market segments:
1️⃣ Innovators (2.5%): Tech enthusiasts who love experimenting.
2️⃣ Early Adopters (10%): Use tech for competitive advantage.
3️⃣ Early Majority (30%): Pragmatists who need clear ROI.
4️⃣ Late Majority (40%): Cautious adopters who wait for proven solutions.
5️⃣ Laggards: Resistant to change.

The gap between early adopters and the early majority separates hype from value—where most technologies fail.

My Experience with These Segments
1️⃣ Innovators
I remember visiting OpenAI HQ with other YC founders, learning how tweaks like adding “think step by step” to prompts improved results.

I also think of a supply chain director I recently spoke with, who uses Python and LLMs in his free time to automate tedious tasks at work.

2️⃣ Early Adopters
These are our core customers: VPs and Directors solving business challenges. They embrace calculated risks, knowing failure is part of the process towards success.

3️⃣ Early Majority
Pragmatists who wait for clear ROI before acting. They see AI’s potential but look to peers for validation.

4️⃣ Late Majority
Cautious adopters who prefer proven ecosystems. They go by the saying: “Nobody was fired for choosing IBM.”

5️⃣ Laggards
Probably not even on LinkedIn.

Where Are We Now?

When Sam predicted AI’s impact, few could have foreseen NVIDIA’s record-breaking earnings, the S&P 500 closing at +21.9%, and AI pilots across Fortune 100s.

Still, I’d argue we remain in the early adopter phase, with the early majority watching closely.

At Mentum, we’re bridging the gap by tying AI to measurable KPIs like:

- Cost reductions
- Hours saved per week
- Tasks completed in workflows

What will it take to cross the chasm?",2,3,0.5301582217216492

Here's today's most interesting thing in AI recruitment...

Mistral AI (Europe's AI golden child) is setting up shop in Palo Alto, with one founder potentially making the move from Paris. 

But here's what's REALLY fascinating...

This isn't just another ""tech company moves to Silicon Valley"" story. Our data shows that:

👉🏻 The San Francisco Bay Area has 9,574 dedicated Machine Learning professionals (up 8% from last year)
👉🏻 The average tenure of AI talent in Silicon Valley is just 1.1 years 
👉🏻 Female representation in AI roles is still only 27% in the Bay Area

The kicker? Despite Macron championing Mistral as Europe's answer to OpenAI, this move speaks volumes about where the world's top AI talent congregates.

Even with a £2B valuation and backing from tech giants (Microsoft, Salesforce, Nvidia), Mistral knows one truth:

You've got to fish where the fish are! 🎣

Think about it - when 59% of the world's top AI talent is concentrated in one region, can any serious player afford not to be there?

What do you think - is this a smart move by Mistral, or should Europe be doing more to retain its AI champions?

And it has absolutely changed my life.


In November 2022, OpenAI irreversibly changed the AI landscape.

I remember my friend first showing it to me when it blew up in the news.

I didn't exactly know how to react.

Today, I’ve gone from trying to get it to create the perfect all time Premier League starting XI (still do this), to helping small businesses adopt it to win more clients.


The truth is: ChatGPT isn’t just a tool for PL starting 11's and creating images of cats giving quarterly growth reports to the board (as shown below).

For entrepreneurs - especially those of us in SMEs - it’s become indispensable.


Here’s how we're using it every day to drive bottom line growth for small businesses:

➡ Content generation: we're setting up automated systems that understand individual personalities, brand voices and industry analysis to write content that converts for busy business owners.

➡ Accelerating outbound success: be it cold emails or LinkedIn messaging, we're using AI to get personal, improve campaign success and write messages that get noticed.

➡ Automated sales: from simple things like sending personalised confirmation messages from form fill outs to creating bespoke proposals from meeting transcriptions - we're helping sales teams save time and close more.



And yes, AI is best used alongside human creativity, but the right combination of both is the catalyst for growth every small business needs.



If this is what GPT is capable after just 2 years - what will it look like when it turns 5?

It's hard to say, but what I can say is: if you're a biz owner and still sitting on AI for your business, you are sitting on a huge opportunity.

306,"This post is for those who can't grasp as to why Jensen Huang is so passionate about ""Accelerating"" the ""#Telecom"" Industry!

🤔 What's in it for him in the long-term?

▪️Great New Growth

""A new era of accelerated computing has begun,"" says Huang in his keynotes. ""Every layer of the computing stack has been reinvented. From Coding-Software with 'rules & logic' to Machine-Learning of 'patterns & relationships'. From Code that runs on CPUs to Neural-Network processed by GPUs."" 

Fusing Radio-Computing and AI-Computing into one architecture seems to be a topic very dear to Huang's heart.

“We’ve fused radio signal processing and AI. This is going to be a #great #new #growth #opportunity for the telecommunications industry,"" he says as he passionately points towards Telco's Sovereign AI-Factories & *AI-RAN*.

▪️Reason for Passion

As per Huang, the next big thing to come is Agentic-AI, models that are capable of making decisions with little human intervention. See Level-3 AI in figure.

“If you can get AI to learn in an unsupervised way, then the human-labeling obstacle-bottleneck is eliminated,"" says Huang, and this is key ""path to amazing new things"" possibly alluding to the arrival of AGI.

The premise here is that Inference Compute availability needs to #explode, and no longer just grow linearly, with ""logically"" bigger #AI models, which have now already entered into ""thinking"" mode, like o1 from OpenAI.

#Inference #Compute requirements can't be simply fulfilled by relying on ""Centralized Inferencing Architecture"" complemented by ""On-Device"" computing. 

To realize this vision of AI-for-Everyone, for a better future, Huang envisions Distributed Edge Inferencing (EI) Architecture.

AI Needs EI - Edge AI Inference!

AI-RAN being the closest to the end-users is crucial in the 2030-2040 timeframe to realize AGI.

▪️ The AI-RAN Bandwagon

The AI-RAN in it's entirety (AI-for-RAN, AI-on-RAN and most crucially AI-and-RAN) is a key path to make AI an integral part of network infrastructure, enabling Telcos to unlock new #revenue streams and deliver enhanced experiences through generative AI, robotics and autonomous technologies. This should excite Telcos.

As for Nvidia, it's interest in AI-RAN goes beyond the tiny #vRAN market. It's all about AI/AGI vision realisation.

It is tied to Jensen's long term view in which he sees ""Telco Edge AI Inferencing"" or EI as one key pillar to realise the real AGI.

Therefore, if Nvidia's accelerated computing stack and Software 2.0 libraries are to be the foundation of Age-of-AI and AGI in next 10 years, then Huang certainly needs AI-RAN to be a primary choice of RAN Architecture in #6G era.

▪️Path Ahead

Fujitsu has demonstrated it's intention with SoftBank""s #AITRAS.

Ericsson and Nokia are more than capable of leveraging Nvidia's AI Aerial Platform and embed their ""secret sauce"" to easily differentiate as an AI-RAN vendor.

🤔 But the age old question in Telecoms is - how willingly can anyone embrace disruption?",2,3,0.5334027409553528

309,"""Finding clarity and connection through slowing down""

Once upon a time, motion was the measure of progress. People dreamed of faster horses, swift chariots, and, later, the blinding speed of rockets that could touch the stars. At great speeds, horizons collapsed, distances became trivial, and the world unfolded as a map rather than a rich, textured reality. Cities turned into dots, mountains into shapes, and rivers into mere streaks of blue.

But what happens when we slow down? Imagine leaving your car behind to walk the same path you speed through daily. The world that once blurred into oblivion reveals its details. The houses have character, stories etched into their facades; the gardens whisper of care and life. Hidden paths beckon, each one a mystery. The hum of traffic fades, and in its place, the symphony of birdsong and rustling leaves emerges. The air carries scents you'd never noticed, and the very ground beneath your feet feels alive, pulsating with a rhythm you now match step for step.

Slowing down doesn’t merely connect you with the external. The inner world awakens too. As the noise of the outside world softens, the whispers within grow louder. Thoughts untangle, emotions clarify, and something profound begins to stir: the faint yet unmistakable hum of the quantum field. It’s as if the universe itself is speaking, a quiet guidance illuminating your path. Intuition sharpens, and you begin to dance—not with your feet, but with the vibration of existence itself. It’s here that the ecstatic whirls of the Sufis make sense, as if they were attuning themselves to the Schumann resonance of 7.53 Hz, the Earth’s rhythmic heartbeat, or the resonant hum of ocean waves..

The everyday journey of life becomes a living meditation. Each step, breath, and heartbeat synchronizes with the pulse of the cosmos. Reality transforms into a tunnel—a series of layers that peel away, revealing deeper truths. The light at the tunnel's end calls not with urgency but with promise. It grows, not like a distant star but like a sun that fills your entire being. You realize this light is not outside of you but within, waiting for recognition.

And then, in no time you cross into the absolute. In that moment, speed, time, and motion dissolve. There is only stillness, yet it’s the most vibrant stillness imaginable. You are no longer a traveler but the journey itself, no longer seeking but being. The light engulfs you, infinite and eternal, and you know you have come home...

315,"🌌 Introducing LociAI: The Next Frontier in GenAI Beyond Text 🚀

Have you ever wondered what comes after LLMs? Large Language Models have revolutionized how we interact with AI, but are we reaching the limits of what text-based systems can do? Enter LociAI, the next leap in GenAI—an AI system that doesn’t just think in words but organizes knowledge in space. 🧠✨

Imagine an AI that builds a 3D knowledge gallery for every topic, query, or problem. Instead of a flat list of text responses, LociAI creates immersive spaces where:
📚 Pages from books are visualized as interactive objects.
🎵 Audio clips and speeches play from dynamic nodes.
🛠️ 3D models showcase technical concepts (think of walking through a molecular structure or a machine's inner workings).
🎨 Images, diagrams, and timelines cluster together to show relationships at a glance.

Why Spatial Reasoning Is the Future

Humans are naturally spatial thinkers—we use maps to navigate the world and diagrams to explain concepts. But AI hasn’t caught up yet. LociAI changes that by mapping relationships between diverse pieces of information and organizing them spatially.
In this 3D mind-map, objects aren't just floating around randomly—they’re contextually anchored:
Related concepts are closer together.
Hierarchies, sequences, and clusters reveal deeper connections.
AI agents can ""walk through"" these spaces, analyzing and synthesizing information to solve problems, answer questions, and even take notes for you.

Why Now?

If LLMs are starting to plateau, LociAI opens up entirely new dimensions of understanding:

More than text: Combine visuals, audio, video, and 3D into one cohesive system.
Flexible reasoning: Move beyond linear answers to explore knowledge from every angle.
Deeper insights: Allow AI to discover patterns and connections even you didn’t know existed.

Applications That Change the Game

🧬 A biologist walking through a spatial map of protein interactions, uncovering potential cures for diseases.
🏛️ A historian exploring a timeline of interconnected artifacts, speeches, and events.
🏗️ An engineer visualizing complex systems in 3D while collaborating with AI to debug or innovate.

The Big Picture

We’re not just training AI to answer questions; we’re teaching it to organize, explore, and reason like a true knowledge worker. As we enter the age of spatial reasoning in AI, #LociAI represents the natural evolution: AI that doesn’t just think like us but sees the world like us.

325,"The AI vs Copyright issue continues 👉🏽 Canadian news publishers sue OpenAI over alleged copyright infringement

According to AP News a coalition of Canadian news publishers has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI for using news content to train its ChatGPT generative artificial intelligence system.

The outlets said in a joint statement on Friday that OpenAI regularly breaches copyright by scraping large amounts of content from Canadian media.

“OpenAI is capitalizing and profiting from the use of this content, without getting permission or compensating content owners,” the statement said.

The publishers argue that OpenAI practices undermine the hundreds of millions of dollars invested in journalism, and that content is protected by copyright.

I think it’s important to highlight that this is not just an OpenAI issue or GPT issue exclusively. 

Most, if not all, commercial LLMs are trained on scraped content from all over the web, which cause a whole load of other issues with biases and garbage content etc.

This issue has been a problem for publishers well before LLMs. Search engines, for example, were getting it in the neck for similar practices of displaying news headlines and summaries etc.

There needs to be clearer regulations and some sort of regulatory realignment to clarify how AI models and content creators should coexist.

The current ludicrous arguments of either banning AI companies from using copyrighted content outright, or deregulate and allow AI companies to just steal creators’ work and totally dismiss creators’ right of ownership are the real barriers to innovation.

It’s just lazy politics and lazy AI with damaging outcomes.

Unfortunately, it won’t get any better with the current global political picture and I feel (perhaps selfishly) that the UK is in a very unique position to lead in this area and bring back our pre-Brexit tech glory. We need to do something beyond talking and debating.

I discussed this issue with UK’s leading tech and media lawyer Raoul Lumb from Simons Muirhead Burton LLP couple of months ago (link in the comments). I welcome your thoughts below.

327,"Let's build robust AI applications using a multi-agent architecture. 

Multi-agent architecture refers to a system where multiple autonomous agents collaborate to solve complex problems. Each agent is specialized, allowing for efficient task execution and adaptability in dynamic environments. 

This architecture addresses challenges such as scalability, flexibility, and efficiency by distributing tasks among agents that can operate independently while communicating and coordinating with one another.

Implementing a multi-agent system can be illustrated through a customer support scenario. Imagine a setup where different agents handle specific inquiries: one agent specializes in technical issues, another in billing, and a third in product recommendations. 

When a customer reaches out, the system intelligently routes the inquiry to the appropriate agent based on the nature of the request. This specialization not only speeds up response times but also enhances the quality of service provided.

The future of multi-agent systems is promising as they offer significant advantages over traditional single-agent solutions. 

There are many platforms and tools such as LlamaIndex, CrewAI, LangChain, SingleStore, Dynamiq, AutoGen, MetaGPT, Haystack, OpenAI, etc that help you build multi-agent applications/systems.

346,"My last post about stepping out of our comfort zones to find (or create) #magic did not 'perform well' on LinkedIn. I hope that it was not because there is no magic left! Perhaps the algorithms are evolving faster than we can keep up with. So, I am trying something different today.

A few weeks ago, a viral LinkedIn post by Kevin Weil, prompt-ly reposted by OpenAI (pun intended), encouraged ChatGPT users to try this prompt:

'Based on what you know about me, draw me a picture of what you think my current life looks like.'

Curious, I decided to give it a try. The result was an imaginative, cartoonised image of my life, showing me immersed in work involving #fintech, blockchain and #tradefinance, with subtle hints scattered across my workspace - elements reflecting my involvement with #electronic documents, #SMEs and international #trade - with filter coffee always by my side! ☕

But one detail stood out (and puzzled me and others who saw the image): what was the white floating 'thing' above my hands?

Unable to let go of my 'floating friend', I turned back to ChatGPT for answers, and this is what it said:

'The white floating figure above your hands is likely the whimsical touch intended to represent #inspiration or 'magic,' symbolising how you encourage others to step outside their comfort zones and find something extraordinary. It might be interpreted as a spark of #innovation, a symbol of #creative energy, or a nod to the transformative work you do in fintech and blockchain.' 😍

Reading this left me lost for words. It felt like coming full circle, returning to the question I posed last week: does magic happen to us, or do we create it through hard work and #perseverance?

So now, I am curious - what does magic look like in your life? Share your thoughts, or better yet, give the viral prompt a try for yourself and share your pictures!

Human & Artificial Intelligence:

We are on the verge of the most profound #IndustrialRevolution in the Human History and #ArtificialInteligence has made significant difference in this entire evolution. #AI is the backbone of innovation in modern computing, unlocking value for individuals and businesses. My thoughts and observations are encapsulated here on how #AI is impacting our lives as humans! 

What I feel is, the connection between the #Humans and #AI is beyond imagination! As AI technology continues to evolve, many thoughts arise about how it impacts humans and workforce. One key aspect to consider is its potential impact on jobs. AI has the potential to automate tasks, generate new job opportunities, and increase productivity. However, ethical implications arise as AI systems make decisions affecting human lives, raising questions about #accountability, #transparency, and #fairness. 

In addition to these concerns, there is also a growing need for collaboration between humans and AI systems. The combination of human expertise and AI capabilities can lead to more informed decision-making and better outcomes. 

AI has the potential to revolutionize industries by automating repetitive tasks, enhancing decision-making, and improving efficiency. It can analyse vast amount of data at unprecedented speeds, providing valuable insights and predictions. AI also offers time and the opportunity to be more human. However, it has limitations, such as relying heavily on data quality and quantity for accurate outcomes, and lacking human-like intuition and creativity in problem-solving scenarios requiring #subjectivejudgment or #emotionalunderstanding. Therefore, it is essential to adopt first-principal thinking and prioritize data quality and quantity for accurate outcomes.

In nutshell, the relationship between artificial intelligence and humans is complex and multifaceted. With careful planning, ethical considerations, and collaboration, we can harness AI's power to benefit society while upholding human values. The future is bright, but only materializes when we work together.

In the recent past, I attended the “Deloitte Day – HR Next” Conference in Switzerland, which aimed to explore the future of HR, specifically the Renaissance of People and Purpose in the context of Artificial Intelligence. Wherein they reinforced on OpenAI, Google AI, Meta Cultivating connections, and supercharging digital transformation in HR topics.

356,"🚨 The Intersection of AI Innovation and Copyright Law 🚨

Today’s news about Canadian media organizations filing a lawsuit against OpenAI highlights a pivotal moment for the future of generative AI. As I discussed in my recent CHCH interview, the issue at the heart of these legal battles is how AI companies use copyrighted content to train their models—and whether this use is ethical, legal, and sustainable.

This lawsuit could signal the need for a shift in how the AI industry operates. One possibility is the emergence of a licensing model, where AI developers would pay for access to high-quality, copyrighted content to train their systems. Such a model could:
- Ensure fair compensation for content creators.
- Encourage responsible and ethical AI development.
- Foster collaboration between AI companies and industries like journalism, rather than conflict.

AI has immense potential to transform industries, but it must be built on a foundation of trust and mutual respect. If we can find ways to fairly compensate creators while still enabling innovation, we may set the stage for a more equitable and sustainable AI-driven future.

📒 The 212-page report (!!!) is packed with great analysis about research, tech advances, and policy. But I wanted to focus on several key findings about the business and economics of AI: 🕵‍♀️

1️⃣ NVIDIA’s Grip on AI: NVIDIA remains the dominant player, with its GPUs powering most of the world’s AI workloads and a $3T market cap this summer. Despite competition, it’s hard to imagine AI’s future without NVIDIA leading the charge. 💻

2️⃣ Revenue vs. Profitability: Per my recent #LLM competition article (link in comments), the report highlights that ""many of the buzziest start-ups working on generative AI... have no identified path to profitability. However, this isn’t true for everyone, as the biggest model providers see revenue begin to ramp up."" Still, AI companies like OpenAI are scaling revenue rapidly but still face steep operational costs. The journey to profitable AI remains complex. 🚀

3️⃣ Costs: ""The inference cost of serving strong models is dropping."" This has big implications for costs, deployments, and competition. 📉

4️⃣ ""AI-first products begin to demonstrate their stickiness in the enterprise."" Again, this echoes one of my arguments: Enterprise is where the money is to be made. New data suggests enterprise spend and retention are improving. 🧗‍♂️

5️⃣ Investment Boom: AI companies are on track to raise $100bn in 2024, mainly driven by mega-rounds, but questions around long-term sustainability loom. 💰

6️⃣ Productization of AI: AI labs are no longer just model builders—they’re product innovators. From ChatGPT to Llama, success now hinges on building solutions, not just tech. 🛠️

7️⃣ Regulatory Pressure: With growing concerns over competition and AI’s societal impacts, the regulatory landscape is heating up. The report suggests this is, in part, driving some exits and consolidation. ⚖️

Bottom line: AI economics are evolving fast. Is your business and investment strategy able to adapt?

We are witnessing an increased focus on reasoning systems like o1 with open-source alternatives QwQ and Marco-o1 from Alibaba Group. Inference provider Fireworks AI has launched a compound system called F1 to improve capabilities using existing models.

This shift from scaling language models raises questions about whether scaling benefits are diminishing? Two key approaches are emerging:

1. Enhanced Test-Time Computation: Models are prompted to perform detailed reasoning steps before producing answers - essentially an advanced version of chain-of-thought prompting with MCTS.

2. Compound AI Systems: Multiple specialized models and tools work together to achieve capabilities beyond single models. This challenges the ""bitter lesson"" principle that simple scaling of data/models outperforms specialized techniques.

The development of o1 by OpenAI hints we may be reaching scaling limits, prompting exploration of these alternative approaches. This raises fundamental questions about the optimal path forward: continued scaling, specialization, or networks of specialized systems.

Another interesting development - a research group working on o1 replication was able to surpass o1 with distillation on a task!  Despite training only on mathematical problem-solving data, the models demonstrated strong generalization to open-ended QA tasks and became significantly less susceptible to sycophancy after fine-tuning.

They are calling it the Bitter Lesson of Simple Distillation - distillation works but erodes the research culture. This shift from “how it works” to “what works” represents a fundamental change in research mentality that can have far-reaching consequences for the field’s future innovation capacity. Without new experiences, we risk creating a generation of researchers who are more comfortable with applying existing solutions than developing new ones from fundamental principles.

376,"Summary of AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order by Kai-Fu Lee

In AI Superpowers, Kai-Fu Lee explores the competitive landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) and its transformative potential, focusing on the rivalry between China and the United States. As a former executive at Google China and an influential AI expert, Lee offers a unique perspective on how AI will reshape industries, economies, and societies worldwide.

Key Themes:

	1.	The AI Revolution
Lee describes how AI has entered a new phase driven by data, computing power, and engineering talent. The era of groundbreaking AI research has matured into one of rapid implementation and commercialization. He emphasizes that AI’s ability to optimize decision-making will disrupt industries such as healthcare, transportation, and finance.
	2.	China vs. Silicon Valley
	•	China’s Strengths: Lee argues that China has an advantage in AI implementation due to its vast amount of data (from its large, tech-savvy population), fierce entrepreneurial spirit, and government support. Companies like Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu are leading innovation in areas like facial recognition, e-commerce, and social media.
	•	Silicon Valley’s Strengths: The United States still leads in foundational AI research, with companies like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI producing cutting-edge advancements. However, Lee notes that American innovation faces challenges like regulatory hurdles and market saturation.
	3.	Four Waves of AI Development
Lee outlines four stages of AI disruption:
	•	Internet AI: Optimizing online services, e.g., recommendation algorithms in e-commerce and entertainment.
	•	Business AI: Using AI to improve business decision-making with structured data, e.g., in banking or insurance.
	•	Perception AI: AI applications that integrate sensors with the physical world, e.g., facial recognition, autonomous vehicles.
	•	Autonomous AI: Fully automated systems like robots or driverless cars transforming logistics and manufacturing.
	4.	The Impact on Jobs
Lee predicts massive job displacement due to AI, particularly for routine and repetitive tasks. However, he emphasizes that jobs involving creativity, empathy, and human interaction (e.g., healthcare, education) will become increasingly valuable. He advocates for retraining programs and social safety nets to address the societal challenges posed by AI.
	5.	Moral and Ethical Questions
Lee stresses the importance of ethical AI development, especially given the power it grants governments and corporations. Issues such as surveillance, privacy, and inequality must be addressed to ensure AI benefits everyone.
	6.	A New World Order
Lee foresees a future where China and the U.S. dominate AI development, creating a new world order. However, he emphasizes that this technological rivalry should be directed toward solving global challenges like healthcare, climate change, and poverty, rather than escalating geopolitical tensions.",1,3,0.5306138396263123
377,"Is ChatGPT at risk of shutting down?

Elon Musk still remembers his disagreement from nine years ago when he left OpenAI.

After nine years, he is the ""Doge minister"" and is suing again to stop OpenAI from changing from a non-profit to a profit-making company.

Do you remember? OpenAI's agreement states that its investors cannot invest in direct competitors, making it hard for many AI companies to access large funds like those from Microsoft, Nvidia, and Softbank.

If Musk wins the lawsuit, OpenAI may have to abandon its profit-making model and even repay its most recent investors. Without funding, ChatGPT could face closure due to high costs.

The situation is complicated because Musk has more power now.

As I mentioned before, we should not rely too much on foreign tools; we need to develop our own AI applications. Vietnam already has several good products (Such as LovinBot AI White label platform) that can serve as alternatives.

381,"Is it hot in here, or is it just my LLM getting creative?

Many platforms let you set how ""creative"" you want your LLM to be.

Usually, they are changing the ""temperature"" of the model.

Let's dive into what that means.

(Play along at Tokens for Education - <URL> - and set the temperature in the top right).

--
Let's set the stage.

I said to the model, tell me a random word.

It said:

Dog - 50%
Tree - 30%
Car - 15%
Monkey - 5% 
--
Now let's chat about temperature.
--
Temperature = 0 means models are ""greedy"".

Greedy is a technical term here (Copilot used to call this precise).

It means they will always pick the ""most probable"" token (confusing aside - the probability can change on different requests - LLMs are stochastic ... random, by default).

With our example data, a temperature of 0 means the LLM will ALWAYS pick Dog.
--
Temperature = 1 use ""standard sampling"".

Again, that is the technical term, but simply it means, they respect the probabilities.

If the temperature is 1, there is a 50% change of it choosing dog, 30% tree, etc.
--
This means, if the temperature is in between 0 and 1, it will ""sharpen"" the probabilities towards more likely tokens.

If the temperature is > 1, it will flatten the probability and make less likely tokens more common.

Normally if you set the temperature to 2 with OpenAI, you end up getting garbage.",2,3,0.5288876891136169

388,"Story behind the photo:Year 2013 , Lei Jun, CEO of Xiaomi Technology visited Tesla, accompanied by a certain VP of #globalsourcing and #supplychain from Tesla, Peter Carlsson., also known later as the founder of NorthVolt.

By then, Xiaomi Technology was merely known as a Chinese smartphone challenger with high cost-performance ratio.

Both of them saw the tremendous potential in #EV, but life ironically drove them to different paths. Long story short:

- In 2015, Peter Carlsson cofounded Northvolt and raised biggest funding ever in European history (15billions$). Earlier this month, NorthVolt filed for bankruptcy under chapiter 11 in US and Peter Carlsson stepped down from the position of CEO.

- Lei Jun founded Xiaomi Auto much later in 2021. He announced to fully self-fund the project, « I’m ready to put my whole personal fortune and entrepreneurial reputation for this ultimate battle ». 
For the outsiders, year 2021 wasn’t exactly the best timing for entering the game . The #EV market landscape was already a Red Sea with incumbents but especillay the emerging automakers (Nio, Xpeng, LI, Leapmotor..) 

Against all odds, Xiaomi Auto reached serial production of SU7 in a record breaking time of 230 days with 100000 deliveries, whereas Tesla took 12 years (2003-2015) to reach the same milestone. Ok, the comparaison isn’t fair as Tesla laid ground work for everyone else, but still. 

Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford Motor Company says he's been driving a Xiaomi EV for the past 6 months and doesn't want to give it up.

So, what could be possible reasons that drove the differences of outcome ? 
It’s obviously a compound result but let’s take some wild guesses:

Skellefteå, the Swedish factory location of NorthVolt, where daily sunlight varies between 2hs and 20hours with a local population of 30000people. Can we seriously imagine world class talents ( workers as well as engineers) are attracted to move in with their families?

On the other hand , Lei Jun was known as the « spammer », as a CEO of Fortune 500 company, he once called personally 90 times some big shot engineer , just to « beg » him to join the company. Sam Altman also shared similar approach through early days of OpenAI  .

From winning presidential election to building world’s most successful company , Everything boils down to having the right people around you.

That's because:

Some Ships Cannot Be Turned Around

Intel Monday announced CEO Pat Gelsinger has resigned after a difficult stint at the company. The once-dominant chipmaker’s stock cratered as it missed the AI boom and was surpassed by most of its rivals.

Gelsinger took over as Intel’s chief executive in February 2021, returning to the company at which he worked for decades, including as chief technology officer. He had left Intel for a stint as CEO of software giant VMware.

At Intel, Gelsinger was tasked with turning around the iconic American tech giant that was struggling against unprecedented competition, production delays and the departure of top talent. But during his tenure, the company’s prospects continued to decline, as it became clear the company had fallen behind on another major technology wave and despite billions of dollars in US government spending to support its domestic chip manufacturing.

Intel’s (INTC) stock plunged 61% during Gelsinger’s tenure. The stock rose 3% in early trading.

The company announced in August that it would lay off 15% of its staff as part of an effort to slash $10 billion in costs and “fundamentally change the way we operate,” as Gelsinger said at the time.

Intel once had a stranglehold on the world’s computer chip market, with Intel chips inside PCs and Macs. But the mobile computing wave of the past two decades caught the company off-guard, leaving it to fall behind rivals. In recent years, Intel was caught on its back foot by the AI wave.

The year after Gelsinger took over as CEO, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, which took the world by storm. The rest is history: NVIDIA, which was once a tiny Intel competitor, is now the second-most-valuable company in the world after it bet big on chips that can power the massive datacenters that power AI. Nvidia’s $3.4 trillion market value is 33 times bigger than Intel’s $104 billion value.

Nvidia’s stock has surged nearly 720% over the past two years, as the company became the talk of the tech world and one of the most valuable public companies in the world.

Intel’s struggles have raised questions about a potential takeover by a rival like Qualcomm, a possibility that may be more practical under the incoming Trump administration, which is expected to be less aggressive in pursuing antitrust concerns.

Gelsinger stepped down as CEO and resigned from Intel’s board effective December 1, the company said Monday. He will be replaced by interim co-CEOs David Zinsner, Intel’s chief financial officer, and Michelle (MJ) Johnston Holthaus, general manager of Intel’s client computing group, as the company conducts a search for a permanent new CEO. Holthaus has also been named to the newly-created CEO of Intel products, which will oversee, among other things, its data center and AI product efforts.

It gave a very diplomatic answer when I asked if what it recommended was better than Tian Tian Chicken Rice at the same Food Centre.

So — what’s for lunch for you? Some Tian Tian Chicken Rice perhaps? Or would you go for Ah Tai? Or would you agree with ChatGPT that all chicken rice are good generally?

Would love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below!

But more importantly, do tune in to the radio broadcasts of my interview with Oliver out today and Monday at 4.40pm Singapore time, as well as the full podcast out on Monday evening, as Oliver and I tackle topics such as the future direction of research for OpenAI, its move to set up shop in Singapore and hold its first Developer’s Day here, future expansion plans, and the potential of generative AI versus current market expectations.

The Evolution of OpenAI’s ChatGPT: Smarter, Yet Still Glittered with Flaws

Artificial intelligence is advancing at an unprecedented pace, with each new iteration of OpenAI’s ChatGPT showcasing smarter, more intuitive, and highly capable models. These leaps forward excite users worldwide, but distinct patterns in performance suggest the journey to true general intelligence (AGI) is not without its hiccups.

What is this about?

OpenAI’s ChatGPT models are among the most impressive AI systems available. Their ability to handle complex queries, assist with coding, or even hold conversations using voice demonstrates remarkable progress. Yet, as these systems evolve, certain frustrating behaviours persist. Coding assistance often loops, repeating the same response endlessly unless the user resets the interaction. Meanwhile, the new voice model stops abruptly mid-conversation, forcing users to restart or prompt it to resume.

Why is this important?

These issues underline the challenge of creating reliable, human-like AI. While the technology’s potential is vast—from democratising knowledge to boosting productivity—these limitations remind us of the distance yet to travel toward AGI. They expose the fine balance between intelligence and consistency, and they show how even “smart” systems can fall into avoidable traps.

How does it impact society?

For users, these repetitive loops and interruptions can hinder workflows and diminish trust in the AI. This friction affects everyone from coders relying on accurate support to individuals engaging with AI for education or creative purposes. On a broader level, these shortcomings invite healthy scepticism about AI’s readiness to fully replace or supplement human tasks. They also raise questions about transparency in AI development—how do developers prioritise solving such challenges?

How can we use this today or in the future?

Recognising patterns in ChatGPT’s behaviour provides valuable insights for both users and developers. For users, learning to navigate or circumvent these quirks can improve productivity. For developers, acknowledging flaws as steps on the path to refinement builds user confidence. As OpenAI marches toward GPT-5 and beyond, addressing these usability concerns could turn today’s ""glittered"" progress into tomorrow’s polished breakthroughs.

Conclusion

OpenAI’s journey is remarkable, but not without imperfections. To borrow a saying, “you can’t polish a turd, but you can dip it in glitter.” Despite flaws, each iteration brings us closer to systems that redefine interaction. The glitter may wear off, but the foundation is undeniably solid—and the future of AI is worth the patience.

405,"Calling AI applications “wrappers” misses the mark. 

When companies like Facebook, Shopify, and Salesforce launched, no one dismissed them as mere “SQL wrappers.” SQL and relational databases operated behind the scenes without releasing consumer-facing products. Developers built upon these tools to create solutions without the foundational technology overshadowing their work.

Today, companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have brought foundational technology to the forefront by releasing products like ChatGPT and Claude directly to consumers. In my opinion, this visibility has skewed public perception, leading some to label new applications built on these models as just “wrappers.”

From my experience developing AI identity verification solutions at Veratad, I can say that building effective LLM-powered applications requires proprietary development that goes far beyond simple API integration. It requires:

- Prompt engineering
- Fine-tuning
- RAG
- Chaining
- Agent development and tooling
- Agent workflow building
- Observing, Experimenting, Evaluating, Iterating, Annotating
- UI/UX design
- Etc

All this work is proprietary and essential to delivering real value to customers. 

So, should we really dismiss these AI applications as mere “wrappers,” or should we acknowledge the significant innovation and effort that goes into building solutions that truly meet users’ needs?

407,"Interesting read in the largest financial newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad. The majority of the population in The Netherlands seems to be very sceptical when it comes to the use of AI. One notable exception: OpenAI's ChatGPT. Many people like to use this application for various purposes. Personally, I hardly ever use ChatGPT, but this has more to do with my ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" mentality.
The newspaper attributes the scepticism/ downright distrust of AI, to one recent dark page in history, and where AI played a key role. 
Almost 4 years ago, the entire Dutch Government fell in relation to the use of a child welfare system that wrongly labelled thousands of parents as fraudsters (“toeslagenaffaire”). The system used by the Dutch Tax Authorities consisted of AI risk-based algorithms. This system displayed a bias to certain groups within society believed to be more likely to commit fraud. This crisis also highlights some of the dangers of AI. While the Tax Authorities have made reparation payments, much of the damage cannot be undone. Right now around 35,000 people have been recognized as having been adversely affected by the algorithm, and also by the enforcement and behavior of the Tax Authorities. Many of these affected individuals were/are faced with large debts and, as a result, people have lost homes, their jobs and thousands of children even have had to be rehomed. ##ai #toeslagenaffaire",1,3,0.53560471534729
408,"I just finished the first challenge from Advent of Code. Afterward, I decided to see how AI would handle it. At first glance, the solution looked good—I even learned a simpler way to sort a slice of integers in Go! It would have even produced the correct result.
However, the problem became apparent upon closer inspection of the generated code, specifically this part:
totalDistance += int(math.Abs(float64(left[i] - right[i]))))

Here, left is a long list of integers, and converting each element to float64 just to calculate the absolute value and then convert it back to int is unnecessary. It’s inefficient when a simple abs helper method for integers would suffice. Interestingly, GPT fixed this when I pointed out that the conversion to float64 might be costly.

But then again, what can you expect from a tool that—despite all the money spent developing it—still can’t count how many “r”s are in “raspberry”? (This meme is so old that OpenAI should’ve just hardcoded the answer by now, xD.)

OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, recently shared insights on OpenAI’s pivot toward more closed AI models—a decision stirring up big discussions in the tech community! 🚀 Balancing safety and innovation with openness has proven challenging, and Altman highlighted how OpenAI aims to mitigate risks while still pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI.

👥 Why the Change? With AI advancing at lightning speed, OpenAI has opted for a more closed approach, prioritizing controlled development over unrestricted access. Altman emphasized the need for guardrails as technology scales to ensure AI tools are used responsibly and effectively. 🌍 This direction, however, has sparked notable criticism from figures like Elon Musk, who voiced concerns about OpenAI straying from its open-source mission. Musk argues that openness is crucial for transparency and accountability.

🛠️ Striking the Right Balance OpenAI's decision brings up important questions about how to foster innovation in AI while maintaining ethical standards. Altman’s take? Finding this balance is essential to achieving a safe, trustworthy future for AI applications in business, health, and beyond.

410,"The real bottleneck in AI isn’t the models—it’s the data.

While foundation model providers like OpenAI ($157B) and Anthropic ($40B) dominate headlines in the GenAI era, here’s a fact many overlook: AI teams still spend 80% of their time on data preparation and only 20% on model building (hasn't changed much in the last years).

So what does this mean? 👇

1️⃣ Massive growth potential in data infrastructure layer.
Companies tackling this issue are poised to grow. Databricks ($43B valuation) is already benefitting, but others like DataRobot and Alteryx are also redefining AutoML and MLOps.

2️⃣ The GenAI hype wave is evolving.
As the buzz around models settles, the focus will shift. The real game-changers? Those who optimize the entire AutoML/ MLOps process.

3️⃣ The next frontier in AI is about reducing the 80%—and the companies who do this best will drastically facilitate mass adoption of AI.

414,"Thanks for making a separate thread on the subject, I think this situation is going to be interesting in the next year.

Given that Musk's beef with Altman is all about the transition away from the original not-for-profit mission of OpenAI, I would be surprised now that Altman is trying to finalise that, if Musk doesn't. And with Musk's new political role, he has a lot more firepower, including on the federal contracts side, where all of the tech bro's have big interests.

One thing you didn't mention though, is it also depends how much Musk sees this as a personal beef. I have no clue on that. But it may mean, for example, that it plays out in other areas Altman is connected to, especially:

Worldcoin (I refuse to call it World) might be a particularly hot environment, especially given Trump's playing towards the crypto crowd recently. But there Trump himself may have conflicts (WLF?).

Also Helion and Okra might come under fire, via the government contracts path.

TBH I wouldn't want to be Altman going into this. Musk *only needs to run down the clock* on the transition, and Altman's own push to be recognised as ""critical infrastructure"" puts the discussion in an arena where he doesn't have the advantage, and delays are legion.",3,3,0.5369957685470581

Eliza is a groundbreaking AI agent framework created by the ai16z team. It's designed to be a completely autonomous system that can interact across multiple platforms. 

The technology allows AI agents to engage in natural conversations, analyze market data, and execute trading strategies without human intervention.

The technical foundation of Eliza is impressive. At its core, it can connect to various AI models including Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT series, and local models through Ollama. 

This flexibility lets developers choose the best AI model for their needs. The system also includes advanced memory systems for maintaining conversation context, and can process market sentiment in real-time.

On the infrastructure side, we are running Eliza on a distributed AWS architecture. Developers can also run it locally using Docker containers, making it accessible for testing and development.

The project gained widespread attention in November 2024 due to an unexpected token launch situation. Two ELIZA tokens appeared in the market, creating confusion in the trading community. 

The original team at ai16z, led by developer Shaw, had to address this by endorsing a new official token. They also offered to protect early investors with a 10% allocation of the new token.

Despite the token drama, Eliza represents a significant advance in AI agent technology. Its ability to connect with different language models, process real-time data, and maintain consistent personality traits across platforms makes it a powerful tool for autonomous AI applications in the crypto space.

OpenAI launches #SearchGPT as an alternative to Google & Perplexity. OpenAI Launches ChatGPT Search in direct challenge to Google's Search Empire. 

Advantages:

🗣Natural language input instead of keywords
📝Direct answers instead of lists of links
🔗Source information for transparency
❓Possibility for follow-up questions and refinement

Challenges & potential:

While AI models are strong in terms of creativity and contextual rendition, source availability, transparency and, in some cases, accuracy remain critical issues. However, with advances in AI and machine learning, a time could dawn when the traditional way of internet research is behind us.

And of course: Google itself is investing massively in AI and will certainly not leave the field easily.

435,"Yesterday, I received another plaque recognizing my outstanding work, but it dawned on me once again that many in the real world are unaware of the vast array of GenAI opportunities, the significance of traditional AI, and the critical need for 'business plus technical' expertise to drive AI success in the enterprise space.

For many, the only ""AI professions"" are AI researchers and engineers, with OpenAI being the sole AI company that comes to mind. 

There is a pressing need for education in the real world so that professionals understand that cognitive scientists are just as vital to the AI revolution as the AI engineers at OpenAI and other AI labs. Without their subject matter expertise, the friction points in human-AI synergy will remain hidden obstacles.

In fact, without subject matter expertise in a vast number of professions, many niche AI projects won't fly!

This year, I have designed upskilling programs for businesses that highlight up to seven non-technical AI careers their staff can upskill in, such as AI strategist, AI project manager, AI trainer, and AI educator, among others.

Why's this important?

In the US market (2024), AI strategy is the most expensive item in the budget of most enterprise AI programs, consuming 17% of the entire budget, followed by training data, hardware, controls and compliance, software, product development, talent, analytics, and other items.

Every company should have an ""AI educator"" who isn't just someone who has taken a few online courses but possesses the knowledge, vision, and experience to chart an AI transformation journey from Level 1 AI maturity (awareness) to Level 2 (active), Level 3 (operational), Level 4 (transformative), and ultimately Level 5 (systemic).

The AI educator must also play a pivotal role in guiding the organization's path across the OpenAI AGI scale—from Level 1 (Chatbots) to Level 2 (Human Reasoners), Level 3 (Agents), Level 4 (Innovators), and finally Level 5 (Autonomous Organizations).

If you need assistance with your AI strategy and discovering what kind of skills, culture, and resources you need to achieve sustainable AI success, I'm here to share my excellence with you.

My experience and work in Saudi Arabia, Canada, India, Oman, Tanzania, and Nigeria have been nothing short of exemplary. Check out my profile for testimonials and more insights!

437,"SORA LEAKING + OPENAI’S TROUBLING RESPONSE: A PATTERN OF NEGLECTING ARTISTS.

The recent '#Sora access #leak' incident highlights a recurring issue: OpenAI’s inability to properly recognize and support the #artists who contributed to its successes.

Let’s rewind to 2022. Under the leadership of Natalie Summers, OpenAI before launching Dall•E, launched a promising artist program. Natalie understood the potential of a thriving artist community. She led initiatives that allowed artists to collaborate with OpenAI developers, giving feedback that directly shaped the tools we see today. I brought renowned Dutch artists such as ✰ Arno Coenen, ★ Olivier Teepe, Bas Kosters, Martin Koolhoven, Suzy One Kenobi and Tinkebell to her group. Yet OpenAI made no effort to learn who these artists were. A missed opportunity.

The Sora program mirrored this shortcoming. Only 7 of all the artists were briefly featured in a blog post in March 2024. Artists value recognition. A simple spotlight on their work. It’s not always about money. Imagine if OpenAI had created a platform to showcase artist portraits, their Dall•E and Sora art, interviews about their creative processes. This approach would've built goodwill within the creative community. Instead, artists felt like “debuggers”.

Instead, OpenAI started hiring sales- and young, cheap PR reps who seemed disconnected from OpenAI’s history and dismissive of the people who helped build the brand: At their 2023 Cannes Lions rooftop event, I experienced this firsthand. Despite my pioneering DALL•E experiments—including ‘Let’s Be Friends,’ the world's first AI-generated, animated short film, it won an important award at Oberhausen’s 69th International Short Film Festival—these PR-kids showed little interest in OpenAI’s foundational contributors. Instead, I was treated being a nuisance.

Once Natalie Summers tried to build bridges with artist, but it seems OpenAI didn’t support her vision. Or perhaps even Natalie underestimated the importance of recognizing artists. Hereby - again - I'm offering you my help. Either way, the result is clear: a missed opportunity to turn contributors into ambassadors.

The Sora leak underscores this neglect. Walter Woodman, co-creator of 'Shy Kids' their 'Air Head', told me in an interview I had with him at The AI Film Fest Amsterdam, how OpenAI’s utilitarian approach treats creators as liabilities rather than partners.

What OpenAI Must Do:

1: Create a dedicated Artist Platform with profiles, interviews, galleries. 2: Maintain open communication channels like we had during the early DALL•E days. 3: Recognize artists as partners who bring unique perspectives, not just as beta testers.

Supporting artists isn’t just good ethics—it’s good business. Companies like Midjourney (their magazine is a smart example) have built 'love brands' by growing strong relationships with their communities. OpenAI must do the same. ASAP.

Let’s hope OpenAI learns from its mistakes and charts a new path forward.",3,3,0.5324313640594482

Coca-Cola has become synonymous with Christmas ever since it began using images of Santa Claus enjoying a Coke in the 1930s.

However, it was the iconic “Holidays Are Coming!” ad from 1995 that truly captured the hearts, remaining a festive favourite for over two decades.

This memorable ad depicted a convoy of Christmas-lit trucks arriving in a snowy town, spreading joy and cheer.

Now, 29 years later, Coca-Cola has brought this beloved ad back. But this time, they didn’t spend $1 Mn+ to recreate it.

Instead, Coca-Cola used Gen AI to produce the ad. From the iconic snowy town to the Coca-Cola truck and even the characters in the ad, everything was created using AI.

This isn’t the first time Coca-Cola has used AI. Last year, they launched a limited-edition drink, Coca-Cola Y3000, which featured the label: “Co-Created with AI.”

It’s clear there’s a significant shift happening in the advertising world, with AI gradually finding its place in commercial applications.

However, Coca-Cola is facing backlash from audiences online.

Many feel this new AI-generated ad lacks the authenticity and warmth that define the Christmas spirit.

Coca-Cola isn’t the only legacy brand to receive criticism for using Gen AI in their campaigns. 

In June, Toys “R” Us faced similar backlash for a commercial created using Sora, a tool developed by OpenAI.

And the feedback? Let’s just say it wasn’t the glowing endorsement OpenAI hoped for. 😜

What happened next was no surprise, as OpenAI pulled Sora offline within a couple of hours. But here are some questions that arise from this situation:

👉 How do we ensure creators are fairly valued in tech-driven industries? Do organizations actually care?

👉 When companies collaborate with creative communities, what’s the right way to do it?

As someone who’s spent years in creative industries, this hit home. The lesson here isn’t anti-technology—it’s pro-artist. 

Creativity and tech can thrive together, but only when creators are treated as partners, not just free testers.

Oh, and another thing: this Sora story reminds me of the risk of relying entirely on someone else’s platform. Whether it’s renting software or building your business around one social media channel, control isn’t always in your hands. 

If your source of income can vanish overnight, like Sora did, what’s your backup plan?

No easy answers here. Maybe someone smarter will comment below. 🤷‍♂️

467,"🚀 Mastering Multimodal AI: Building a GeoGuessr Bot with Vision LLMs 🌍

The rise of multimodal large language models (#MLLMs) is transforming industries—blurring the lines between visual perception and text-based reasoning. But what if we take this concept and gameify it?

Enter the #GeoGuessr AI Bot, a groundbreaking project that blends Python, computer vision, and #LLMs like OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude 3.5, and Google Gemini 1.5 to autonomously master the art of location guessing in the wildly popular GeoGuessr game. This project is more than just a playful experiment—it’s a lesson in engineering AI systems that bridge modalities effectively.

🔑 Here’s what makes this bot fascinating for AI/ML practitioners and consultants alike:

1️⃣ Prompt Design Meets Image Analysis
At its core, the bot integrates a prompt that guides the LLM to:
⏺️ Analyze a screenshot of a location.
⏺️ Reason based on visual and contextual clues.
⏺️ Predict precise latitude and longitude coordinates.
The success here lies in iteratively refining instructions for #Vision LLMs to ensure both reasoning depth and actionable outputs.

2️⃣ Seamless Automation with #Python
Using #pyautogui and LangChain, the bot interacts with GeoGuessr’s interface autonomously:
⏺️ Captures game screenshots.
⏺️ Maps predicted geolocations onto pixel coordinates.
⏺️ Clicks on the mini-map for location guesses.
The beauty? Each step is modular and reusable, applicable for other visual automation tasks.

3️⃣ Overcoming Projection Challenges
Handling Mercator projection distortions (a map-based complexity) was a show-stopper. This project tackles it through calibration—using two known landmarks to extrapolate accurate pixel positions for any location. A practical tip for developers dealing with geographic data!

4️⃣ Practical AI in Action
This experiment reveals the limitations and strengths of current multimodal LLMs:
⏺️ Models are brilliant at contextual reasoning.
⏺️ But they still need engineered fail-safes to handle unpredictable outputs (like inconsistent formatting of predictions).

📚 For Consultants:
This project is a goldmine of analogies to explain AI to non-technical stakeholders:
#Multimodal AI = Machines that “see” and “think” like humans.
Workflow Automation = Efficiency through #repeatable, #scalable AI pipelines.
Limitations = AI is powerful but thrives within well-defined guardrails.

💡 Key Takeaway:
Building this bot teaches us how to combine existing AI technologies creatively—breaking down silos between vision and language processing while leveraging Python’s ecosystem. The application? Beyond GeoGuessr, this workflow can inspire solutions in GIS automation, visual data extraction, and digital assistants.

""This project combines the power of Power BI and OpenAI to automate CV screening, making candidate matching more efficient and data-driven.""

I'm always interested in innovations in CV screening, as this challenge is only becoming more complex. 
 
Recently, I came across a post by Oscar Martínez Valero, where he shared an impressive project that uses AI to automate the candidate matching process.

I haven't seen this done in Power BI before and I appreciated Oscar's UI's feature of a horizontally scrolling candidate list.  

Typically, most ATS vendors display a list view, but I liked the different interface. 

However, I imagine it becomes less clear when dealing with 100 applications.

Today, we reached build number 500 of Meal plans & recipes: OH, a potato! on Testflight. Just the 2 of us with limited time and money. 

500 different iterations, 500 quick fixes and big changes, conflicts and resolutions.

It's been wild! It is wild.

The product looks completely different from where it was 2 years ago, 1 year ago, and 6 months ago. We've grown from a hobby into a running business that has paying users and generates over 800€ euro a month. It might not seem like a lot to some, but if you try doing something on your own, you'll quickly learn how difficult it is to monetize without pouring in marketing money.

Since this number made me reflect, here are my favorite moments from this year:

1. We thought we were launching on Product Hunt in the afternoon, but we miscalculated the time zone difference and ended up launching in the morning. My phone was going crazy, and it was hard to grasp what was happening. The first few hours were insane, but we secured Product of the Day, Product of the Week, and AI Product of the Week. We never thought OH, a potato! would do so well so we unfortunately weren't strategic about our launch timing and missed our chance to win product of the month (we launched at the end of the month 🫠). 

2. We introduced a bug in one of the updates, and users started writing to support, claiming we had locked them out of the app. Radu obviously panicked, but I was thrilled that people cared about our product and used it regularly. 🥰

3. We offered lifetime access for free for a limited time to drive more ratings and reviews, but right before the launch, we introduced a bug that broke the core UX. It wasn't a quick fix, and it took us a few days to recover from it emotionally. But guess what? Now, we have a strict protocol for regression testing. 🤘🏻

4. We drove over 20,000 downloads organically just by making the app free for a limited time. We also learned that free users can be the toughest. If something doesn't work as expected, they go straight to the App Store review section, whereas paid users tend to send a kind email to support... 🫶🏻

5. One day, someone wrote that the cookbook scanning feature wasn't working anymore. After some time, we realized he had scanned 100 (!) recipes in 2 days. At one point, while experimenting with OpenAI, we implemented a safety measure limiting scans to 100, thinking no one would exceed that. He definitely had his Potato-AHA moment. 💡

We now have a roadmap; I create bug tickets, we hold weekly prioritization sessions, and most importantly, Radu Lupu has accepted that I'm better at design and I have the final say there. 😏

I'm describing a soon ultra-valuable paradigm shift to the development cycle where the AI autonomous agent can suggest and make improvements to itself for iterations cycles measured in hours and not weeks.

This system too takes a lot of engineering, testing, and deploying (human in the loop and guardrails) but you can image an unstoppable application-layer company that's able to iterate in this way. The absolutely exciting part is it's now entirely possible with the 01-preview and 01 by OpenAI's reasoning engine and those that we'll have access to in the future (as they continue to be more cost-effective etc.).

Data: Kingdom Stays .ai can show you right now a large, proprietary documentation center of industry-specific procedural sets that power our AI agent through agentic RAG, resulting in industry expert decisions as default settings. This internal documentation center is so large, it's equivalent to 1000 manuscript pages worth of information that accounts for nearly every situation.

2. Different types of 2-sided network effects between multiple user categories of the same AI application layer, where the more there are users on the platform in one category provides a higher value for those users in another category. We can imagine what are called ""managed marketplaces"" where we will see new marketplaces that simply wouldn't exist otherwise unless an a robust AI agent manages aspects of the 2-sided marketplace(s). Network effects like this and data network effects are very powerful and sticky for users to use and can be the differentiator between you and a competitor in the future.

And it will completely change how you interact with AI

OpenAI quietly released this insane new feature in beta.

Here's what it can do:
↳ Write code directly in VSCode
↳ Make commits through Terminal
↳ Debug in Xcode
↳ Access your development environment

But there's something bigger happening here.
This isn't just about coding assistance.
It's OpenAI's first step towards building Agentic AI systems.

Think about it:
Chat interface (2022)
↳ Basic text conversations

App integration (Now)
↳ Direct interaction with your tools

Agentic Desktop control (Coming soon)
↳ Full system automation

The ""Operator"" agent is next. 
Bloomberg reports it's launching in January.

This means AI won't just suggest stuff...
It will be able to think and take actions like a human.

But here's what everyone's missing:
The real value isn't in the automation.
It's in the learning.

Watching AI interact with your tools,
You'll discover workflows you never knew existed.

493,"The State of Generative AI in the Enterprise and what i says to me! Last week, Menlo Ventures released its 2024 report, which surveyed 600 U.S. IT decision-makers. Here is what it says to me: 👀

Open-source AI is slowly taking over. Enterprises want to build their own AI solutions. Infrastructure spending has increased 8x, deployment investment has increased 3.8x, and build vs. buy strategies have shifted from 20% to 53%. The complexity of deploying your own AI models takes more time compared to the faster, simpler option of using APIs. Combining this with open models approaching closed performance and OpenAI losing its market share, the direction seems clear.

I was expecting fine-tuning to decrease, not because it is not needed. More because, with better models, it moves to a later stage in the lifecycle of AI applications. Thats why see an increase in RAG. As a company, you should always try to make things work and then optimize. Focusing on UX/DX, reliability (evaluation, tracing, logging) is more important for most companies in the current state. Fine-tuning will help these companies drive down costs significantly later.

Workflow automation will be the biggest growth area in the next two years in terms of use case adoption.

Vector databases likely won’t win long-term in enterprises. PostgreSQL and MongoDB's vector capabilities are good enough and already present in most companies.

The real challenge isn't about model capabilities anymore. We're in a similar situation as with cloud adoption in 2010. My advice is simple: build, learn, and iterate. Enterprises that invest in understanding these technologies will have significant advantages in the future.

495,"Recently, I attended amazing events like Qatar Science & Technology Park  AI WEEK'24, ESI Conference’24, and sessions at Qatar University, along with my fellow peers Madhavi Dewalkar, Siddhi Ajay Naik and Purva Honrao. I learned a lot about how AI is transforming industries like healthcare, robotics, education, and workforce development. It’s exciting to see so many companies using AI to make their products better and more helpful.🚀

One startup really stood out to me. They created a VR simulation powered by models like OpenAI and Llama, where users could talk to an AI avatar to practice soft skills. In the simulation, the avatar was assigned a cleaning duty but wasn’t doing it properly, causing trouble for the entire team. My challenge was to convince him to take responsibility and complete the task. It felt so real—it was like interacting with an actual person! Even though I didn’t succeed in persuading the avatar (my approach was a bit too harsh 😅), it was a fun experience. This shows how AI can revolutionize career and personal development through immersive tools that make skill-building and professional training more effective and engaging.

But it got me thinking: what if the data used to train these AI systems is biased? AI learns from data, and if that data has flaws, it can lead to unfair outcomes. For example, many companies use AI to screen resumes, but if the AI is trained on biased data—like past hiring decisions that favored certain groups—it might unfairly reject qualified candidates. This means talented people could be overlooked simply because of biases in the system, showing how the AI tools we rely on can shape decisions in ways we may not always notice.

I believe that while reducing bias in AI is possible, fully removing it is unlikely because humans themselves are inherently biased. Bias can never be completely eliminated, but we can work to identify and address it through more research and careful oversight. It’s crucial to have humans involved to evaluate and guide AI, ensuring its decisions are fair and reliable. AI can assist us, but it will never replace human creativity, intuition, or emotions.

These experiences reminded me that while AI can be incredibly helpful, we need to use it responsibly.

Over the past three months, the WAN-IFRA, the World Association of News Publishers Newsroom AI Catalyst program has been an incredible journey of innovation and transformation. We’ve seen 16 newsrooms from around the world take bold steps forwards, turning ambitious ideas into tangible AI prototypes that are already beginning to shape how journalism can evolve in the digital age.

From tackling operational challenges to exploring audience engagement in new ways, these teams have not only built tools but also redefined what’s possible when newsrooms embrace emerging technologies with purpose and creativity. They’ve navigated technical hurdles, confronted ethical questions, and worked collaboratively to imagine a future where AI augments and empowers their newsrooms.

But this is only the beginning. These prototypes represent the first stage of what we hope will become long-term transformations within their organisations. The next steps involve scaling, iterating, and embedding AI solutions into workflows in ways that drive real impact for journalists and audiences alike.

Thank you to the incredible teams who brought their energy, creativity, and commitment to this program, and to everyone who supported along the way. I’m excited to see how these ideas evolve and how they inspire even more innovation across the industry.

Thanks too to Martin Froehlich, Vincent Peyrègne, Thomas Jacob, Fergus Bell, David Caswell, Christophe Israël, Stéphanie Barsch, Laura Oliver, Laurens Vreekamp, Tim Robinson, Leonie von Elverfeldt, Khalil A. Cassimally, Mago Torres, Ally Lee-Dudley, Natalie Sykes and everyone else who made this happen - truly a dream team to work with. And to OpenAI, David Duxin, Varun Shetty for the support throughout.

498,"Established companies would often hesitate to disrupt their own business strategy. After all, there's no harm in staying true to the old adage: 'if something is not broken, don't fix it'.

The problem is that the world moves fast. If not a bit too fast, sometimes. It only takes one unicorn startup to upend the market and dictate customer behavior; many big companies one CEO reshuffling away to becoming the next Apple.

But this reality is not a blanket permission to bet your entire business on the next shiny idea. Fearlessly taking risks is simply a romanticized version of 'not knowing what the hell you're doing'. It may be fun to daydream being the next OpenAI, but these companies are edge cases.

For many of us, it's all about taking calculated risks. 
 
It's about gradually moving the needle by constantly making small decisions where the rewards far outweigh the risks. Sure, you may fail in some of them, but when the alternative is certain death by competition, the smart thing to do is think outside the box, exhaust your best options, and roll the dice — praying you get the chance to roll again tomorrow.

500,"🚀 Building AI-Powered Chat Apps with the Groq API: 

My Experience vs. ChatGPT
I recently experimented with the Groq API to build a simple chat application in Python, leveraging the llama3-8b-8192 model. It’s always exciting to compare emerging tools, so I couldn’t resist putting it head-to-head with ChatGPT!

What I Built
A minimal Python app that:
 1️⃣ Prompts User Input: Asks users to type a question or prompt.
 2️⃣ Processes with Groq: Sends the input to the Groq API for a response.
 3️⃣ Displays Output: Prints the model’s reply in real-time.

You can explore the project here:
 👉 GitHub Repository: <URL>

Groq API vs. ChatGPT: Key Takeaways
💡 Customizability:
Groq API allows you to choose specific models (like llama3-8b-8192), giving fine-grained control over responses and performance.
ChatGPT, while versatile, is often pre-configured with fewer model-selection options unless you're using OpenAI's advanced endpoints.
⚡ Performance:
The Groq API shines in speed for lightweight tasks and provides a streamlined interface for developers.
ChatGPT delivers richer, often more nuanced responses but may involve slightly higher latency for complex queries.
🔑 Ease of Use:
Both are developer-friendly, but Groq's focus on simplicity makes it an excellent choice for quick prototyping.
ChatGPT has broader documentation and support for advanced use cases, such as embeddings or fine-tuning.

Why I Chose Groq for This Project
Speed: Needed quick iterations to prototype the app.
Focus: Groq’s API feels tailored for streamlined use cases, which was ideal for my lightweight chatbot.
