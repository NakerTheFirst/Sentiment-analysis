150,151,"🤖💸 When Microsoft & OpenAI Took ""It's Complicated"" to Billion-Dollar Levels 💸🤖

In 2019, Microsoft slid $13.75 billion over to OpenAI, whispering, ""You’re the future of AI, don’t let me down."" And, like any good friend, they struck a reasonable deal: Microsoft would get 75% of OpenAI's profits until they got their investment back—and even after, they’d still keep 49%. That’s commitment. 😆

But this bromance is starting to hit some, uh… “AI-dentity” issues. OpenAI, once a noble nonprofit, suddenly realized capitalism pays for cooler servers. 💸 Now they're trying to ""redefine"" themselves as a for-profit without making things awkward about that $14 billion sitting in a nonprofit. Enter Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to sort this out—aka the corporate marriage counselors. 📈👔

But hold up: control issues are brewing! Microsoft is OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider and slipped OpenAI tech into everything from GitHub Copilot to Azure. But lately, they’ve been side-eyeing each other. After a tough year for OpenAI, Microsoft spent $650M to hire talent from Inflection AI—maybe as a “backup AI BFF.” 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Meanwhile, OpenAI is flirting with Oracle for some cloud freedom. ☁️

Then there’s the AGI clause. If OpenAI invents AGI (the robot version of a human), Microsoft…loses access. Talk about awkward! What’s AGI? Nobody really knows, which makes it the world’s priciest mystery box. 🎁

So, here we are—Microsoft and OpenAI still smiling for the cameras, but secretly ready for solo careers. Welcome to the world’s weirdest tech ""situationship.""

154,155,"OpenAI uses news training ChatGPT, Canadian media claims billions of dollars

Canada's largest news organization today filed a lawsuit against the American artificial intelligence (AI) company OpenAI, accusing OpenAI of using their articles to help train the AI ​​chatbot ChatGPT without permission.

Agence France-Presse reported that according to the statement, media including The Globe and Mail and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) accused OpenAI of copyright infringement, ""scooping large amounts of content"" and profiting from the use of this content.

This behavior was done without consent or payment to news organizations. These news organizations claimed that these articles were illegally scraped and used to train the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, and claimed 20,000 Canadian dollars (approximately) for each article. NT$472,000), the total compensation may reach billions of dollars.

The Canadian federation of news organizations said: ""Journalism is in the public interest and OpenAI's use of other companies' news for its own commercial interests is not. It is illegal.""

In response to the lawsuit, a spokesperson for OpenAI said that the OpenAI chatbot was trained using publicly available data ""in accordance with fair use and relevant international copyright principles, which is both fair to creators and supports innovation.""

The spokesperson added that OpenAI also cooperates with news publishers.

This is the first lawsuit filed against OpenAI by Canadian media. According to the legal filing, the groups, which also include Postmedia, the Canadian Press and the parent company of the Toronto Star, are asking the court for an injunction to prevent San Francisco-based OpenAI from continuing or future ""unauthorized Improper authorization to use their work.

""As we embrace the opportunities brought by technological innovation, all participants must abide by the law and the use of our intellectual property rights must be conducted under fair conditions,"" he said.

Oracle seals partnerships with Azure and AWS. For what exactly?

Let's take a closer look.

🔴 Oracle Cloud  x Amazon Web Services (AWS)  🟠
Oracle is preparing its entry into the cloud leader's platform by making its databases and Exadata directly accessible in AWS. Note that the service will be more widely deployed in 2025.

The promises? Optimized connection between Oracle databases and AWS applications, simplified billing via AWS Marketplace, and most importantly, native integration with AWS analytics and AI services, notably Bedrock. No more juggling between different platforms!

On the other side.

🔴 ORACLE x Microsoft Azure  🔵
The partnership with Microsoft is already well-established. Oracle database services run directly in Azure datacenters, offering minimal latency and deep integration with Microsoft services, notably Azure OpenAI.

💡What's the common thread between these two alliances?

A desire to simplify business operations with unified support and a seamless experience. Oracle recognizes that multicloud has become the norm and is adapting to customer needs.

❤️ The feedback would be positive
↪️ Major groups welcome these initiatives that allow them to deploy their strategic workloads more efficiently.

161,162,"🚀 Bold Predictions for AGI in 2025: Can OpenAI Crack the Code?

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has set the AI world buzzing with his latest statement: artificial general intelligence (AGI) might just be around the corner, with a potential breakthrough in 2025. 🤯

In a recent interview with YC founder Gary Tan, Altman revealed that the path to AGI is “basically clear” and hinges on engineering efforts rather than scientific breakthroughs. This confidence is striking, particularly given reports of slower progress across the industry.

*Key updates*:
Orion Model: The rumored ‘Orion’ model reportedly shows a smaller improvement over GPT-4, particularly in coding tasks — sparking mixed reactions.
Foundations Team: OpenAI has created a dedicated team to tackle fundamental challenges, including the scarcity of high-quality training data.
o1 Reasoning Model: Backed by OpenAI researchers Noam Brown and Clive Chan, this new model promises new scaling capabilities, potentially bypassing previous limitations.

It’s a fascinating time in AI, with these developments hinting that engineering innovation might help break through scaling barriers and accelerate progress towards AGI. 

Altman’s vision for 2025 could redefine the pace and scale of advancements we see in artificial intelligence.

162,163,"OpenAI search is here – is it over for Google?

OpenAI just released its latest feature: integrating web search directly into ChatGPT for real-time, AI-powered results. 

With OpenAI’s fine-tuned GPT-4o model behind it, users can now access up-to-date information seamlessly across iOS, Android, and desktop platforms.

Why does this matter?

	1.	No Ads: OpenAI’s search engine is ad-free (for now), unlike Google’s ad-cluttered search results.
	2.	Fewer Hallucinations: Real-time data helps improve factual accuracy.
	3.	Partnerships: OpenAI has teamed up with media giants to ensure responsible content usage, steering clear of copyright conflicts.

This move is a big move from OpenAi. However, AI-powered search is significantly more costly than traditional search, so it’ll be interesting to see how they plan to cover these expenses for free users.”

163,164,"Yesterday while I was cleaning my computer, I found a piece of GenAI History. 

In December 2021, I saw a post on Reddit about a new method to generate an image from a text and  I was mind-blown. The post was about machine learning algorithms, VQGAN and CLIP. The first was an algorithm to generate images and the second ( created by OpenAI in 2021) excelled in matching text and images. 
Some Reddit users were exploring how they could use VQGAN and CLIP together to create images from text (""GAN Art""), and a researcher created a Google Colab notebook that everybody could use to test VQGAN+CLIP. 

If I remember well, it took about 45 minutes to generate the below image, with as input ""CRM"" (Thanks Salesforce). It also output a video to show you the evolution of the generated image, which was pretty cool.

It’s happening faster than I expected.

In just a few weeks, Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google have made big strides toward building AI agents that can actually use computers like humans do.

Here’s the latest:

- Anthropic’s API (Live): Claude can now operate software, though still learning.

- OpenAI’s Operator (Rumored): A browser-operating agent tackling real-world tasks like booking travel.

- ChatGPT macOS Integration (Beta): Interacts with desktop apps like Xcode.

- Google’s ‘Project Jarvis’ (Rumored): Uses screenshots to navigate websites and complete tasks.

Why this matters: Until now, AI has been smart but stuck behind the glass—giving advice but unable to act. 

That’s about to change. If a human can do it on a computer, AI agents will soon be able to do it too.

For developers and entrepreneurs:

- Start thinking about specialized agents—focused tools that excel at specific tasks.

- Rethink your product roadmap: 
computer-using AI will unlock entirely new opportunities.

Alibaba's QwQ, an open-source model featuring 32B parameters and a 32k-token context window, now outperforms OpenAI's o1 in both mathematical and scientific reasoning. It surpasses o1-preview on the AIME and MATH mathematical benchmarks and exceeds o1-mini on GPQA for scientific reasoning tasks. Although it falls short of o1 on LiveCodeBench coding evaluations, QwQ still outperforms other leading models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.


This is what QwQ team says:

""Through deep exploration and countless trials, we discovered something profound: when given time to ponder, to question, and to reflect, the model’s understanding of mathematics and programming blossoms like a flower opening to the sun. Just as a student grows wiser by carefully examining their work and learning from mistakes, our model achieves deeper insight through patient, thoughtful analysis. This process of careful reflection and self-questioning leads to remarkable breakthroughs in solving complex problems.""

However, I experimented with QwQ and found it to be overly complicated and inefficient. It took six minutes to solve the sequence problem: ""What's next: 10, 11, 13, 17, 26, __?""

Let's go.

🌟Agnieszka Niezgoda, PhD, PhD on Agent-based approaches in LLM solutions. 

💡 If you have a large context, the inquiry will cost you more. Cache layer makes it cheaper and faster;
💡 The speech covered RAG technique, LangGraph, LangChain, Autogen (with a human in the loop) frameworks;
💡 Large Action Models (LAMs) will emerge further.

🌟Magdalena Ostoja-Chyżyńska shared the experience of her design studio with AI. 

💡 AI tools in their current state don't replace designers. Consider AI as your Co-Creator, Co-Artist if you wish. It helps with the early stages of the process;
💡 Jr. Designers rapidly progress to the Mid. level now thanks to AI. Middle to Senior is more tricky though;
💡 Tools: Midjourney, Figma AI, Exactly AI (outcome close to your prompt/style), Photoshop, Stable Diffusion, OpenArt AI, Claude AI, Slides AI, Plus AI, OpenAI o2 model. 

🌟Inga Apiecionek shared 7 lessons on AI adoption at Ringier Axel Springer Polska.

💡 AI strategy cannot exist in a vacuum. Start with your ""why?"". Align it with your company strategy. Discovery phase is a must;
💡Use the combination of metrics while assessing AI implementation;
💡 Example. Microsoft says GitHub Copilot helps to develop new code 55% faster. If we assume that a software dev spends 10% of their time on coding on average (we can argue here regarding the %). Multiplying 55% by 10% gives us only 5.5% of real acceleration;
💡 Garbage in > Garbage out. High-quality training data is a must. Even with the best AI models.

🌟Zuza Kwiatkowska spoke about deepfakes and how to fight them. 

💡 A 10-sec recording of your voice is enough to generate an audio deepfake for disinformation or phishing;
💡 Longer recordings enable deepfake generation on the fly;
💡Educate your teams, children, and parents, on the latest technology and its threats. 

🌟Piotr Mieczkowski on cybersecurity from the perspective of people in Poland. 
Insightful statistics. Kids security topic resonated the most with me as the father of two. 

🌟Marcin Banaszkiewicz on authenticity crisis on LinkedIn. 

💡LinkedIn is a Human-to-Human platform;
💡People don’t buy products and services on LN. Nobody cares about the content aiming at selling something or promoting a company. And the majority of LN content falls exactly in that category;
💡People seek people who can give them value;
💡People tend to skip AI-generated texts;
💡Construct your post like a practicing hands-on surgeon, rather than like a university professor;
💡So choose what you want: A. have a beautiful and correct text with AI and lose your audience, or B. spend more time and stay authentic and not ideal. 

I choose the B option.

182,183,"T R U M P  x  A I  C Z A R  - President-elect Trump is considering naming an AI czar in the White House to coordinate federal policy and governmental use of the emerging technology, Trump transition sources told Axios.

Why it matters: Elon Musk won't be the AI czar, but is expected to be intimately involved in shaping the future of the debate and use cases, the sources said.

Behind the scenes: Told the role is likely but not certain.

Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy — who are leading Trump's new outside-government group, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — will have significant input into who gets the role.

Musk — who owns a leading AI company, xAI — has feuded publicly with rival CEOs, including OpenAI's Sam Altman and Google's Sundar Pichai. Rivals worry Musk could leverage his Trump relationship to favor his companies.

The big picture: Trump, partly in response to the enlarged coalition that fueled his victory, plans to be super attentive to emerging technologies.

183,184,"Total self-brag: I created $1Million worth of enterprise-grade code this month!

💡 How did I measure this?
The SCC Report evaluates code performance, efficiency, and estimated project value. Using this guide, I discovered that my work this month achieved:
- 96.8x performance ratio: What would normally take 8 years of development was done in 1 month. (I have 3 days to hit the 100X milestone!)
- $1M+ equivalent value: That’s what companies typically pay for similar software development. (My rates are a little lower)

Oh, and I built a tool to summarize SCC results into a fancy report—it’ll be open-sourced soon (because why not?).

How I Did It:
1️⃣ Plan First: Document workflows, data models, architecture, and pseudocode.
2️⃣ AI-Driven Development: Nearly 100% of the code was generated and tested by AI. My role? Orchestrator. Minimal typing (mostly voice commands). No Google. No Stack Overflow.

Amazon is investing another $4 billion in Anthropic – double its current stake – as it seeks a bestie in the AI race.

The two firms were already close: Anthropic uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its essential cloud provider and AI model training partner. That’s helping it develop Claude, the humanlike AI assistant that competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. And now, the startup says AWS will become its primary cloud provider and provide it with the chips it needs to train future models. So if Amazon’s investment in Anthropic is repaid through chip sales, that's part of the plan: it's trying to get developers to switch away from Nvidia's industry-leading chips.

Nvidia is the undisputed market champ when it comes to the advanced chips that are needed to run generative AI. And its biggest customers are AWS, Microsoft, and Alphabet. But these Big Tech companies hate to pay big bucks for someone else’s technology when they can build stuff in-house. That’s why the three are each working to develop their own chips. But don’t go shedding any tears for Nvidia: the behemoth’s advanced semiconductors are still well ahead of everyone.

US antitrust regulators are casting an eye over the AI industry – and that includes Microsoft, OpenAI, Amazon, Anthropic, and Alphabet. The feds are worried that these goliaths might just be too dominant. In fact, only last week, the Department of Justice recommended that Google be forced to sell off its search business. Whether that happens is still unclear, but it shows the level of scrutiny that the giants of tech might soon be under.

But what does it mean, and who decides this, especially when the vast majority of us around the world are consumers and users rather than creators of the underlying technologies and models. 

While regulation is one approach that many are rightfully exploring and pursuing at the national and even international levels, governance protections built into the corporate constituent document level has for some time intrigued many seeking to balance people, profit and planet to better align shareholders integral to capital raising and the other crucial stakeholders impacted by corporate activity. 

So many of the new and increasingly influential #GenAI maker companies have adopted novel corporate governance structures, from Anthopic's Long Term Benefit Trust structure, to Elon Musk's xAI's Nevada Benefit Corporation. OpenAI famously started as a tax-exempt Delaware incorporated non-profit company and evolved into ""capped profit"" structure in 2019 that opened the door for critical investment from VCs and Microsoft that allowed it to allow the world to access ChatGPT. Reuters has reported that after closing its US$6.6 billion fundraising valuing it at US$157 billion in October, Open AI is now seeking to be reorganised into a Delaware public benefit corporation. 

PBCs have already started to go public in the US, beginning with the IPO of Laureate Education in 2017 that has been followed by companies such as insurancetech Lemonade and pasture-raised egg producer Vital Farms in 2020 and eyewear maker Warby Parker in 2021. 

Pioneer Post recently published a provocative article on ""Is OpenAI impact washing by becoming a public benefit corporation?"" and I was glad to be invited to share my thoughts alongside Melanie Rieback, Luke Fletcher James Gauci Rhodri Davies (see link in comments). While the reported high burn rate of OpenAI explains the need for capital, VCs seek exits, and there are precedents for PBC IPOs. And although the Delaware PBC legislation allows shareholders of 2% of the PBC's outstanding shares to enforce the balancing requirement, that would be a high bar indeed for most activist shareholders and NGOs of a US$150+B company!

A few days ago, I did something kinda wild—I emailed Sam Altman (yes, the CEO of OpenAI  👀) with a feature request in  ChatGPT.

The idea had been stuck in my head for a while: a feature in ChatGPT 
I thought about it, overthought it, and almost let it go. But then this little voice in my head said, “What’s Stopping you from sending a mail to the CEO of OpenAI ?”

So, I took a deep breath, opened my email, and wrote to Sam Altman. 
No fancy intros. Just an honest, straight-to-the-point message about my idea.
I hit send, thinking, “Well, I don’t really think I will get a reply.”

Was I nervous? Totally. Did I think he’d actually reply? Not really.

But guess what?  He replied.

For a second, I just stared at my screen. Sam Altman replied to me. 

That reply made me realize something: we hold ourselves back way too much. We overthink, assume things won’t work out, and stop ourselves before we even start. But honestly? What’s the worst that could happen? No reply. The best that could happen? A connection that could change everything.

So this is your sign to Expect the Unexpected.

💡 What is AGI?
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to a machine’s ability to understand, learn, and apply intelligence across a wide range of tasks—just like a human. 

Unlike current AI models, which are trained for specific functions, AGI would have the versatility to solve any problem and reason in multiple domains autonomously.

Here’s what Altman just revealed:

1️⃣ Engineering, Not Science, is the Key
↳ Altman explained to YC’s Gary Tan that the path to AGI is “basically clear.” Now it’s all about execution, not new scientific breakthroughs.

2️⃣ Orion’s Mixed Results
↳ OpenAI’s rumored “Orion” model shows only minor improvements over GPT-4, especially in complex coding. This has sparked debate on whether AGI is as close as Altman suggests.

3️⃣ New “Foundations Team” on Core Challenges
↳ OpenAI has created a team focused on critical issues, like the shortage of high-quality training data — something essential for AGI scaling.

4️⃣ O1 Model’s Scaling Potential
↳ Researchers Noam Brown and Clive Chan believe the new o1 reasoning model might break current scaling limits, potentially accelerating progress toward AGI.

💡 Why It Matters
If Altman’s prediction is accurate, OpenAI could leap from its current AGI scale (level 2 of 5) to the ultimate level 5. Such a breakthrough would mark a transformative shift for the entire AI industry.

Musk had originally sued OpenAI in March 2024 in a San Francisco state court, before withdrawing that complaint and refiling several months later in federal court. Attorneys for Musk in the federal suit, led by Marc Toberoff in Los Angeles, argued in their complaint that OpenAI has violated federal racketeering, or RICO, laws.
In mid-November, they expanded their complaint to include allegations that Microsoft and OpenAI had violated antitrust laws when the Chat GPT-maker allegedly asked investors to agree to not invest in rival companies, including Musk’s newest startup, xAI.
Microsoft declined to comment.
 In their motion for preliminary injunction, attorneys for Musk argue that OpenAI should be prohibited from “benefitting from wrongfully obtained competitively sensitive information or coordination via the Microsoft-OpenAI board interlocks.”


“Elon’s fourth attempt, which again recycles the same baseless complaints, continues to be utterly without merit,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement.
OpenAI has emerged as one of the biggest startups in recent years, with ChatGPT becoming a major hit that has helped usher massive corporate enthusiasm over AI and related large language models.
Since Musk announced xAI’s debut in July 2023, his newer AI business has released its Grok chatbot and is raising up to $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation, in part to buy 100,000 Nvidia chips, CNBC reported earlier this month.
“Microsoft and OpenAI now seek to cement this dominance by cutting off competitors’ access to investment capital (a group boycott), while continuing to benefit from years’ worth of shared competitively sensitive information during generative AI’s formative years,” the lawyers wrote in the filing.
The attorneys wrote that the terms OpenAI asked investors to agree to amounted to a “group boycott” that “blocks xAI’s access to essential investment capital.”
The lawyers later added that OpenAI “cannot lumber about the marketplace as a Frankenstein, stitched together from whichever corporate forms serve the pecuniary interests of Microsoft.”
In July, Microsoft gave up its observer seat on OpenAI’s board, although CNBC reported that the Federal Trade Commission would continue to monitor the influence of two companies over the AI industry",1,,

I’ve always admired its elegance and innovation. 🍎✨

But lately, Microsoft’s strides in Generative AI have left me in awe. 🚀

Satya Nadella’s keynote at Ignite was incredible!

The number of announcements at #MicrosoftIgnite was truly mind-blowing.
 
One thing is clear: Microsoft isn’t just riding the AI wave—they’re defining it.
 
By harnessing AI’s evolving universal interface, reasoning and planning capabilities, and long-term memory and context, Microsoft is paving the way for an agentic 🤖 world where AI acts on our behalf across work and life:

   Personal agents 🧑‍💻
   Organizational agents 🏢
   Business process agents 📈
   Cross-organization agents 🤝
 
It’s fascinating to see how these tools are revolutionizing industries, boosting productivity, and shaping the future.
 
Meanwhile, Apple’s recent announcement of “Apple Intelligence” feels… underwhelming. Despite being unveiled a month ago, it’s not expected until March 2025—and even then, the features don’t seem as groundbreaking.
 
Is Apple playing catch-up in this new era? 🤔 Or do they have something revolutionary brewing behind the scenes?

220,221,"A lazy Sunday afternoon, reading some papers. Then I come across a thought-provoking article by the Alibab MarcoPolo Team on ways to improve ""reasoning"" capabilities (you know I am not too fond using that word for the extended inferencing GenAI models do to imitate human reasoning, but alas). Using the Marco-01 model, finetuning Qwen-7B (Huggingface, if you want to try), showing 32B params, they show impressive improvements on various reasoning tasks. You might think that this is what we hear regularly (and we do), so why is this something one posts about? 

My picks: 
a) it is a much smaller model then the competition (lower footprint, smaller hardware needs, etc)
b) it's an open-source model (Apache 2.0 license), which will start to become an argument in a world of proprietary models
c) whereas OpenAI o1 series are using inference-time scaling, QwQ 

Compare it with the OpenAI model o1, using a technique called inference-time scaling to improve its reasoning abilities. This allows it to generate more responses and review them, leading to better performance on tasks that require complex thinking. o1 has shown strong results in standard tasks with known or expected outcomes like math, physics, and coding. The QwQ model is trained on OpenAI O1 CoT, but also the Marco-01 CoT and a very interesting 3rd approach based upon Monte Carlo method (1940s) ""which uses random sampling for deterministic problems which are difficult or impossible to solve using other approaches"" (quote Wikipedia), a development called Monte Carlo Tree Search. And why would that be relevant? Just because it is the algorithm that made AlphaGo beat the worldchampion in Go. MTCS excels in finding moves in ""open search"" spaces, i.e. problems that are not having a clear expected outcome. It helps building reasoning paths in those cases where not ""all is known"", as in most real-world scenarios. 
That's why it caught my interest, as this is another show case of how combining previous AI developments and methods improves the current State of the Art. 

d) it introduces a (still rather naïve) reflection mechanism, that might be developed into something more efficient and powerful. It basically halts the reasoning at critical points and asks for possible retraces (like one could do with the good old depth-first searches in declarative languages such as Prolog)

This latter has shown its value in multi-agent scenarios (featuring a ""critique"" agent. And to some sense such a principle ´is behind GAN too (a Generator-agent and a Discriminator-agent). 

As the authors clearly state: it's work in progress. But the results they show are promising, and the fact that this could improve ""open-ended"" reasoning tasks as in strategy development, process-(re)design and things like product development. Interesting research, provoking thoughts at this first advent Sunday.

It argues the plan could even help “revitalize the American Dream,” sending a jolt through the economy.

Its boldest idea:  A data center five times bigger than anything currently in development, which could cost as much as $100B to build.

225,226,"The AI wars are heating Up: Musk’s xAI vs. OpenAI

Elon Musk is making another move in AI. 

 xAI is  launching a standalone consumer app for its chatbot, Grok. This won’t be just another chatbot in a crowded market. Dig deeper, and you see that Musk is playing a different game, as he always does. 

Grok is positioned to be more than a tool, it’s an experience. Grok is different in many ways.  With access to real-time data from X , Grok offers up-to-date responses grounded in current events and trends. Nothing gets more ‘current’ than people tweeting in real time. ChatGPT does not have access to this. 

Additionally, Grok’s got a personality….or two, to be precise!  Users can toggle between a witty “Fun Mode” or a more straight-laced “Regular Mode,” making interactions feel fresh and personalized.

But then it  goes beyond personality. 

It’s about two different philosophies. Musk’s Grok aims to be politically neutral, edgy, and bold, a sharp contrast to OpenAI’s safer, regular,  more universal approach.

And then there’s the bigger picture. xAI aims to leveraging Musk’s broader ecosystem, from X to Star Link, to create synergies that OpenAI can’t easily replicate. 

The upcoming app might just be the first step in turning Grok into an AI that feels deeply integrated into users’ daily lives.

While Grok’s success will depend on whether Musk can translate his bold idea into meaningful value for users, the battel of ideologies and strategies could shape how we begin to accept AI in its different forms and interact with it. On the technical front, xAI does better v/s GPT 3.5 but not GPT 4.

These are still early days. A lot has to unfold.

 What do you think? Are you excited about he Grok consumer app? Does Grok have what it takes to challenge ChatGPT?

228,229,"This past semester of Fall 2024, I had the privilege of being part of ACM Projects, a 10-week program hosted by ACM UTD —the largest ACM-recognized student chapter in the world! 🌟 

Collaborating alongside my incredible team—Atreya Ghosh, Srinitya Chirravuri, and Vivian Nguyen— and our phenomenal project manager Shreya Ramani, we designed and developed TidyTerms, a website and a chrome extension that transforms how users interact with complex terms and conditions documents.

What is TidyTerms?
TidyTerms simplifies lengthy and confusing legal documents, providing concise and actionable summaries powered by OpenAI’s GPT technology. It empowers users to make informed decisions by quickly understanding key highlights, such as:

🛡️ Privacy policies and data sharing practices
❌ Cancellation terms and hidden fees
🔍 Searchable clauses

This tool was crafted to protect consumer rights by making legal language accessible and easy to understand.

As part of the backend team alongside Atreya, I:
- Established and integrated robust user authentication using Auth0.
- Optimized database management with MongoDB for seamless data control.
- Integrated the frontend and backend to power our key features like Document Scanning and AI-driven Highlights Extraction.

Challenges We Overcame:
One major challenge was integrating OpenAI and Auth0 within the constraints of a Chrome extension. Initially, we aimed to run the entire application within the extension. However, due to differing environments and library limitations, we pivoted to include a website, providing the flexibility needed to deliver a complete user experience.

🌟 Presentation Night Highlights
Presenting TidyTerms during ACM Projects Presentation Night was the perfect showcase of our team's dedication, creativity, and teamwork. 🎉 A special shoutout to our industry mentor, Royce Mathews from Dell Technologies for his unwavering support and guidance and for being our biggest cheerleader. 🙌
A huge thank you to ACM UTD and the incredible ACM Projects co-directors, Karina Batra and Syed Mohammad Abis Naqvi for curating this transformative experience. This opportunity not only helped me develop industry-level skills but also fostered lifelong friendships. And of course thank you to our Project Manager Shreya Ramani for her guidance, encouragement, and incredible leadership throughout this journey!

I am immensely proud of my team for creating something impactful and meaningful. The experience has left me excited to tackle new challenges and opportunities ahead!

ChatGPT (the mass-adopted version) turned 2 last Saturday, and we all remember the stats:

1 million users within 5 days, hundreds of features, and over 100M subscribers including premium (around 10% of users are premium users, yours truly among them) and $2.7Bn in annual earnings, more than a 286% increase from 2023 and 37% of that comes from white-labelling to companies using GPT models as their engine. 

Then again, a couple of things have failed to launch since Altman's promise in the past 18 months, one of them is Sora (OpenAI's video generator), which will have tough competition when launched, with tools such as Kling, Genmo, etc. already out. 

The other one is ChatGPT 5 and the promise of AGI, or ""Artificial General Intelligence.""

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE? 
AGI refers to AI systems that match or exceed human-level intelligence across virtually any cognitive task. Unlike current AI, which excels at specific functions (narrow AI), AGI would demonstrate human-like general problem-solving, learning, and adaptability across domains without specialised training.

Some speculate (present company included) that reaching AGI was the main catalyst of the failed coup at OpenAI last year. But over a year later, AGI is nowhere to be found.

IS AGI EVEN REACHABLE, THEN? 
Considering the level of discussion I see online these days + TikTok videos, I'd say AI is way beyond AGI at this point. 

The naysayers might be right for saying what we do see these days isn't AI per definitionem, but with the PISA scores of 2022 being lower than in 2018, where scores dropped by 16.6, 23 and 8.3 in math, reading and science, respectively, from 2003-2022. The projected scores of 2025 won't make you smile either, at 16.9, 21.1 and 7, respectively.  

If that's the case, I'd then gladly say AI is the pinnacle of human evolution to date.

249,250,"Do not trust embeddings unquestioningly for the similarity of short strings.

Lately, I have talked to many technical folks from job boards introducing embeddings into their search/match functionality.

Although this new technology has some significant use cases, you should not trust it unquestioningly.

While working on a simple matching problem, I encountered a fascinating phenomenon: seemingly identical text strings can yield surprisingly different semantic representations. Let me share a practical example from recent experimentation.

Consider these two developer role titles:
.net developer
 .NET Developer

When processed through a modern embedding model, these strings achieved a cosine similarity of only 0.68, which reveals how AI processes text differently than humans.

Let me explain how we measure text similarity in AI. Cosine similarity is our go-to metric in natural language processing. It measures the angle between two vectors in a high-dimensional space.

An embedding model like the OpenAI text-embedding-3-small processes text and converts each phrase into a vector (essentially a list of numbers) in this space. The closer these vectors align, the more similar the meanings. A score of 1.0 means perfect alignment, while 0 indicates a complete difference.

This mathematical approach helps us quantify semantic relationships that might not be obvious to the human eye. In our "".net developer"" example, that 0.68 score tells us the vectors point in roughly the same direction but with notable divergence, reflecting the semantic nuances we discussed above.

So what is happening here? These strings are semantically the same, right? Let’s do a technical deep dive:

1. Token-Level Processing: Modern language models employ subword tokenization, where capitalization significantly impacts token decomposition. This isn't merely about case sensitivity but fundamental representation in the model's vocabulary space.

2. Contextual Embedding Dynamics:
Lowercase ""net"" typically generates embeddings associated with broader network concepts or fish nets. 
"".NET"" produces specialized embeddings closely aligned with Microsoft's development ecosystem
Position-sensitive transformers process capitalized terms differently based on learned patterns from training data

In the case of embeddings, the longer the text you provide, the better the similarity score you can trust. 

Have a look at the same example, but add two more words that improve the context. Suddenly, the score jumps to 0.73.
 
This understanding is crucial for building robust NLP systems. It has practical industry implications for embeddings in search and matches if you aim to develop accurate content-matching systems.

These nuances become increasingly vital as we develop enterprise solutions leveraging generative AI. They impact everything from search relevance to semantic matching in production systems.

252,253,"🌟 Excited to Share My Latest Project: Building a RAG System with LangChain 🌟

As Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Google Gemini continue to change the AI landscape, one challenge persists: they often lack access to company-specific or up-to-date information.

To overcome this, I’ve built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the LangChain framework! This system enables LLMs to retrieve relevant information from external sources (such as research papers) and augment their responses with this knowledge, ensuring contextual accuracy and relevance.

🔥 Shoutout to Innomatics Research Labs for the amazing support, and a huge thanks to Kanav Bansal for the guidance throughout the project! 🙌

Project Highlights:
Focused on Google's ""Leave No Context Behind"" paper (April 2024).
Retrieve: Extracts key information from PDFs and stores it in a vector database.
Generate: Uses GPT-4 to provide precise, contextually-rich answers based on the retrieved information.

This RAG system is a game-changer for use cases like research assistants, knowledge bases, and customer support. It allows LLMs to access and leverage the most up-to-date, relevant information for improved performance!

Story: When I worked at the Pentagon, we had a really sweet elderly secretary Barbara. If I released this I'd call this CallBarbara AI.

Tech: Twilio (phone), Deepgram (TTS), OpenAI (LLM), LangChain RAG (for my information), Calendly (availability), Google (calendar int). Unfortunately Calendly API blows so I had to use google's api. 

Learnings: I could make this significantly faster and more expensive with OpenAI's realtime voice (Speech-to-speech), or an open source version.

257,258,"🚨 BREAKING: Various 🇨🇦 Canadian News Media Companies sue Open AI over copyright infringement, highlighting CIRCUMVENTION of tech protections & breach of the Terms of Use. Will they be successful? Read this:

╰┈➤ The news media companies are legally claiming for a declaration that the OpenAI is liable for:

1️⃣ ""Infringing, authorizing, and/or inducing the infringement of the News Media Companies’ copyright in the Owned Works (defined below), contrary to sections 3 and 27 of the Copyright Act, RSC 1985, c C-42 (“Copyright Act”);
2️⃣ Engaging in prohibited circumvention of technological protection measures that prescribed access to, and restricted copying of, the News Media Companies’ Works (defined below), contrary to, and within the meaning of, section 41 and 41.1 of the Copyright Act;
3️⃣ Breaching the Terms of Use (defined below) of the News Media Companies’ Websites (defined below); and
4️⃣ Unjustly enriching themselves at the expense of the News Media Companies."" 

╰┈➤ The media companies argue they employed technological protection on their websites, including exclusion protocols (e.g., robots.txt) and account and subscription-based restrictions. However, when OpenAI scraped their content for its for-profit activities, it circumvented the protective measures deployed.

╰┈➤  Regarding the infringement of the Terms of Use, they argue:

""(...) each of the Terms of Use expressly prohibit the use of the News Media Companies’ Websites and Works for any use other than personal, non-commercial uses. The Terms of Use also generally prohibit users from reproducing, distributing, broadcasting, making derivative works from, retransmitting, distributing, publishing, communicating, or otherwise making available any of the Works. Any uses not expressly permitted by the Terms of Use require the News Media Companies’ express consent—particularly commercial uses.

Since as early as 2015, OpenAI has breached and continues to breach the applicable Terms of Use for each of the Websites in various ways, including by accessing, scraping, and/or copying the Works for use as part of the Training Data to train its GPT models and/or as part of the RAG Data to augment its for-profit commercial products and services.""

╰┈➤ The Terms of Use breach argument, coupled with the infringement of the technological protective measures claim, might prove to be a successful legal ground for the news media companies to be successful in this lawsuit. Why? Because it diverges the focus of the dispute from potential fair use-based defenses or endless discussions about the technicalities of the LLM training process.

“The shift requires a heftier investment in infrastructure, tools, talent and security.”

“Executives should anticipate this trajectory and plan accordingly.”

“The working assumption should be that AI will become more pervasive and mission-critical over the next 2-5 years; accordingly, its deployment will require a different set of skills, infrastructure, and governance processes.”

Are all the news snippets about hallucinations, not-fully-baked tech, etc just a percentage error that the media amplifies?

Are the polls, social media posts, surveys and news not depicting the real situation (when have our polls and surveys been wrong when it matters)?

295,296,"“The Salesforce CEO said he thinks the future of AI advancement lies in autonomous agents — not the large language models used to train bots like ChatGPT.” “I actually think we're hitting the upper limits of the LLMs right now.”

Over the last several years, he also said “we've all got drunk on the ChatGPT Kool-Aid, leading the average consumer to believe that AI is more powerful than it is and that LLMs are key to advancement in the technology. But there is a burgeoning use of artificial intelligence — autonomous agents, which can be deployed to conduct tasks independently, such as executing sales communications or marketing campaigns — that he says will be more significant than LLMs have been for companies trying to become more efficient and transform the world of work.”

Interesting argument. If one application doesn’t work, try another; might be good advice. But such an argument also reduces the credibility of AI. We’ve already seen the focus of AI change many times, from Watson AI in healthcare to self-driving cars, radiology, and then two years of generative AI. Now GenAI is over, and agents are the next big thing? Hmm. 

One reason for Benioff’s comments might be that “Salesforce offers prebuilt and customizable AI agents for clients seeking to automate customer service tasks.” Similarly, “OpenAI is closing in on a launch date for its own agents, which Bloomberg reported will be able to complete assigned tasks like writing code or booking travel.”

""We have incredible tools to augment our productivity, to augment our employees, to prove our margins, to prove our revenues, to make our companies fundamentally better, have higher fidelity relationships with our customers,"" Benioff said. ""But we are not at that moment that we've seen in these crazy movies — and maybe we will be one day, but that is not where we are today.""

Benioff uses science fiction to buttress his argument, not always a good ploy. He “said the general public has learned about the power of AI agents from movies like the 1984 film Terminator, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and about a cyborg assassin, and the 2002 hit ""Minority Report,"" about police preemptively arresting would-be criminals thanks to a program that detects crime before it occurs.” 

“In Minority Report, the precrime detection program is powered by psychics called ""precogs"" who have the precognitive ability to predict crime before it happens. However, the film is often referenced in conversations about artificial intelligence, as it raised questions about how advanced computer programs could be used to detect and prevent crime.”

Hmm… I don’t think that these examples will cite users, and might anger the public.

What a wonderful and touching trust in OpenAI to be able to fundamentally change the untrustworthy nature of transformer based LLMs that many VCs and a wide range of experts are warning are approaching a solid brick wall.

The promise of Operator as an Agentic gadget driving and driven by GPT is a wonderful marketing delusion designed to get the next round of funding that will be required mid-year, or, I suspect, earlier if they get access to adequate compute resources, which they are complaining about as not being adequate now.

Using this approach (Operator agents) will drive their compute requirements through the roof if it catches on because it will require the reasoning system GPT-o1 which we already know increases compute requirements by one or two orders of magnitude. I suspect this is why Operator will be released on a limited basis, until the data centres can be built and scaled up to meet the compute load and Nvidia can get Blackwell out there.",2,,

298,299,"About a year ago, I started working on the Billion-Dollar LLM Hallucination Problem. One of the keys to solving the problem is to give the LLM a way to remember its training documents, so that it can produce the most relevant tokens for the specific context, not just the most likely tokens across all contexts. The technology for doing this is Neocortix Deep Attribution Networks, which provide the necessary function of Source Attribution in LLMs. Deep Attribution Networks can be used to cite sources from the training dataset, to detect hallucinations, and, when properly integrated into the LLM, to mitigate hallucinations.

I have found that something great happens when I build a new technology to solve a tough problem: it ends up being useful to solve other problems.  Sometimes those other problems can be just as important, urgent, or economically significant as the original problem I started with.

In September 2024, at Stanford, Gary Marcus was asked about how content creators could be compensated for their contributions to the training dataset of an LLM.  Gary's answer: ""I can start with what would be perfect, but cannot be done, for now.  What would be perfect is, every time an answer is produced, you do what we would call Source Attribution.   You say, where did this answer come from?  If it's 3% from here, and 5% from there, then you just compensate people accordingly.  The problem is, we don't actually know how to do that.  LLMs are black boxes.  We don't know where the answers come from.  That's a huge technical problem.  It's a reason to press for better technology.""

Beautiful.  Gary was summarizing the state of the art prior to Neocortix invention of Deep Attribution Networks and their application into the LLMs.  A few days after his talk at Stanford, I reached out to Gary and told him about the Deep Attribution Network technology I had invented in early 2024, and its relevance to the problem of Proportional Royalty Allocation, and showed him the demo of it working on the Neocortix website (link in first comment). After answering Gary's thorough diligence questions, I invited Gary to join the Neocortix Technology Advisory Board, and a few days later Gary accepted the invitation.

There are currently 35 copyright lawsuits in progress against large AI companies, including OpenAI, Google, Nvidia, Microsoft, Perplexity, etc.  I suspect that many of the defendants will use the argument that ""LLMs are black boxes, we don't know where the answers come from, and there is no technology in the world that can do Source Attribution or Proportional Royalty Allocation.""

Ahem. Well, yes there is. There are working demonstrations on the Neocortix website, with 5 patent applications filed. So, I am wondering how those lawsuits would be affected if the plaintiffs and the judges in those 35 pending lawsuits were informed about the existence of a working technology that can do it? And would the defendants want to get ahead of that?

299,300,"In early 2023, I met Sam Altman.

He said, “AI will change the economy this year.”

Looking back, generative AI adoption has been extraordinary. Yet, we’re still in the early adopter stage.

To understand this journey, I revisited Geoffrey Moore’s Crossing the Chasm, a must-read for understanding how technologies move from niche to mainstream markets.

Moore defines five market segments:
1️⃣ Innovators (2.5%): Tech enthusiasts who love experimenting.
2️⃣ Early Adopters (10%): Use tech for competitive advantage.
3️⃣ Early Majority (30%): Pragmatists who need clear ROI.
4️⃣ Late Majority (40%): Cautious adopters who wait for proven solutions.
5️⃣ Laggards: Resistant to change.

The gap between early adopters and the early majority separates hype from value—where most technologies fail.

My Experience with These Segments
1️⃣ Innovators
I remember visiting OpenAI HQ with other YC founders, learning how tweaks like adding “think step by step” to prompts improved results.

I also think of a supply chain director I recently spoke with, who uses Python and LLMs in his free time to automate tedious tasks at work.

2️⃣ Early Adopters
These are our core customers: VPs and Directors solving business challenges. They embrace calculated risks, knowing failure is part of the process towards success.

3️⃣ Early Majority
Pragmatists who wait for clear ROI before acting. They see AI’s potential but look to peers for validation.

4️⃣ Late Majority
Cautious adopters who prefer proven ecosystems. They go by the saying: “Nobody was fired for choosing IBM.”

5️⃣ Laggards
Probably not even on LinkedIn.

Where Are We Now?

When Sam predicted AI’s impact, few could have foreseen NVIDIA’s record-breaking earnings, the S&P 500 closing at +21.9%, and AI pilots across Fortune 100s.

Still, I’d argue we remain in the early adopter phase, with the early majority watching closely.

At Mentum, we’re bridging the gap by tying AI to measurable KPIs like:

- Cost reductions
- Hours saved per week
- Tasks completed in workflows
